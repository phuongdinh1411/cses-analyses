# CSES Transfer Speeds Sum - Problem Analysis

## Problem Statement
Given a directed graph with n nodes and m edges, where each edge has a transfer speed, find the sum of all transfer speeds between all pairs of nodes.

### Input
The first input line has two integers n and m: the number of nodes and edges.
Then there are m lines describing the edges. Each line has three integers a, b, and c: there is an edge from node a to node b with transfer speed c.

### Output
Print the sum of all transfer speeds between all pairs of nodes.

### Constraints
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000
- 1 ≤ m ≤ 5000
- 1 ≤ a,b ≤ n
- 1 ≤ c ≤ 10^9

### Example
```
Input:
3 3
1 2 5
2 3 3
1 3 10

Output:
18
```

## Solution Progression

### Approach 1: Brute Force Sum - O(n²m)
**Description**: For each pair of nodes, sum up all transfer speeds between them.

```python
def transfer_speeds_sum_naive(n, m, edges):
    # Build adjacency list with speeds
    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for a, b, c in edges:
        adj[a].append((b, c))
    
    total_sum = 0
    
    # For each pair of nodes
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            if i != j:
                # Sum all transfer speeds from i to j
                for neighbor, speed in adj[i]:
                    if neighbor == j:
                        total_sum += speed
    
    return total_sum
```

**Why this is inefficient**: This approach has O(n²m) complexity and doesn't handle the problem correctly.

### Improvement 1: Direct Edge Sum - O(m)
**Description**: Simply sum up all edge weights since we want the sum of all transfer speeds.

```python
def transfer_speeds_sum_improved(n, m, edges):
    total_sum = 0
    
    # Sum all edge weights
    for a, b, c in edges:
        total_sum += c
    
    return total_sum
```

**Why this improvement works**: The problem asks for the sum of all transfer speeds, which is simply the sum of all edge weights.

### Approach 2: Optimized Sum Calculation - O(m)
**Description**: Use efficient sum calculation with proper handling.

```python
def transfer_speeds_sum_optimal(n, m, edges):
    total_sum = 0
    
    # Sum all transfer speeds
    for a, b, c in edges:
        total_sum += c
    
    return total_sum
```

**Why this improvement works**: The optimal solution is simply to sum all edge weights.

## Final Optimal Solution

```python
n, m = map(int, input().split())
edges = []
for _ in range(m):
    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
    edges.append((a, b, c))

def calculate_transfer_speeds_sum(n, m, edges):
    total_sum = 0
    
    # Sum all transfer speeds
    for a, b, c in edges:
        total_sum += c
    
    return total_sum

result = calculate_transfer_speeds_sum(n, m, edges)
print(result)
```
