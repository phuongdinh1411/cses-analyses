# CSES Creating Offices - Problem Analysis

## Problem Statement
Given a tree with n nodes, you need to place offices at some nodes so that every node is within distance k of at least one office. Find the minimum number of offices needed.

### Input
The first input line has two integers n and k: the number of nodes and the maximum distance.
Then there are n-1 lines describing the tree edges. Each line has two integers a and b: there is an edge between nodes a and b.

### Output
Print the minimum number of offices needed.

### Constraints
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
- 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5
- 1 ≤ a,b ≤ n

### Example
```
Input:
5 2
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5

Output:
2
```

## Solution Progression

### Approach 1: Greedy Placement - O(n²)
**Description**: Place offices greedily by finding the node that covers the most uncovered nodes.

```python
def creating_offices_naive(n, k, edges):
    # Build adjacency list
    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for a, b in edges:
        adj[a].append(b)
        adj[b].append(a)
    
    def bfs_coverage(start, k):
        queue = [(start, 0)]
        visited = {start}
        covered = {start}
        
        while queue:
            node, dist = queue.pop(0)
            
            if dist >= k:
                continue
                
            for neighbor in adj[node]:
                if neighbor not in visited:
                    visited.add(neighbor)
                    covered.add(neighbor)
                    queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))
        
        return covered
    
    uncovered = set(range(1, n + 1))
    offices = 0
    
    while uncovered:
        # Find node that covers most uncovered nodes
        best_node = None
        best_coverage = 0
        
        for node in range(1, n + 1):
            coverage = bfs_coverage(node, k)
            uncovered_coverage = len(coverage & uncovered)
            if uncovered_coverage > best_coverage:
                best_coverage = uncovered_coverage
                best_node = node
        
        # Place office at best node
        if best_node:
            coverage = bfs_coverage(best_node, k)
            uncovered -= coverage
            offices += 1
    
    return offices
```

**Why this is inefficient**: O(n²) complexity is too slow for large trees.

### Improvement 1: Tree Diameter Approach - O(n)
**Description**: Use the tree diameter to find optimal office placement.

```python
def creating_offices_improved(n, k, edges):
    # Build adjacency list
    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for a, b in edges:
        adj[a].append(b)
        adj[b].append(a)
    
    def find_farthest(start):
        queue = [(start, 0)]
        visited = {start}
        farthest_node = start
        max_dist = 0
        
        while queue:
            node, dist = queue.pop(0)
            
            if dist > max_dist:
                max_dist = dist
                farthest_node = node
            
            for neighbor in adj[node]:
                if neighbor not in visited:
                    visited.add(neighbor)
                    queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))
        
        return farthest_node, max_dist
    
    def find_diameter():
        # Find one end of diameter
        end1, _ = find_farthest(1)
        # Find other end
        end2, diameter = find_farthest(end1)
        return end1, end2, diameter
    
    # Find tree diameter
    end1, end2, diameter = find_diameter()
    
    # Calculate minimum offices needed
    if k >= diameter:
        return 1
    else:
        # Offices needed = ceil(diameter / (2*k + 1))
        return (diameter + 2*k) // (2*k + 1)
```

**Why this improvement works**: Uses tree diameter properties to determine optimal office placement.

### Approach 2: Optimal Tree Coverage - O(n)
**Description**: Use a more sophisticated approach based on tree properties.

```python
def creating_offices_optimal(n, k, edges):
    # Build adjacency list
    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for a, b in edges:
        adj[a].append(b)
        adj[b].append(a)
    
    def find_farthest(start):
        queue = [(start, 0)]
        visited = {start}
        farthest_node = start
        max_dist = 0
        
        while queue:
            node, dist = queue.pop(0)
            
            if dist > max_dist:
                max_dist = dist
                farthest_node = node
            
            for neighbor in adj[node]:
                if neighbor not in visited:
                    visited.add(neighbor)
                    queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))
        
        return farthest_node, max_dist
    
    def find_diameter():
        # Find one end of diameter
        end1, _ = find_farthest(1)
        # Find other end
        end2, diameter = find_farthest(end1)
        return diameter
    
    # Find tree diameter
    diameter = find_diameter()
    
    # Calculate minimum offices needed
    if k >= diameter:
        return 1
    else:
        # Minimum offices = ceil(diameter / (2*k + 1))
        return (diameter + 2*k) // (2*k + 1)
```

**Why this improvement works**: Optimal solution using tree diameter and coverage properties.

## Final Optimal Solution

```python
n, k = map(int, input().split())
edges = []
for _ in range(n - 1):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    edges.append((a, b))

def find_minimum_offices(n, k, edges):
    # Build adjacency list
    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for a, b in edges:
        adj[a].append(b)
        adj[b].append(a)
    
    def find_farthest(start):
        queue = [(start, 0)]
        visited = {start}
        farthest_node = start
        max_dist = 0
        
        while queue:
            node, dist = queue.pop(0)
            
            if dist > max_dist:
                max_dist = dist
                farthest_node = node
            
            for neighbor in adj[node]:
                if neighbor not in visited:
                    visited.add(neighbor)
                    queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))
        
        return farthest_node, max_dist
    
    def find_diameter():
        # Find one end of diameter
        end1, _ = find_farthest(1)
        # Find other end
        end2, diameter = find_farthest(end1)
        return diameter
    
    # Find tree diameter
    diameter = find_diameter()
    
    # Calculate minimum offices needed
    if k >= diameter:
        return 1
    else:
        # Minimum offices = ceil(diameter / (2*k + 1))
        return (diameter + 2*k) // (2*k + 1)

result = find_minimum_offices(n, k, edges)
print(result)
```
