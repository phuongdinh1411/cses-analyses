# Sort Linked List

![Image represents two linear sequences of numbered nodes (3, 2, 4, 5, 1) and (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) connected by unidirectional arrows indicating a flow from left to right.  The top sequence uses black-bordered circles containing numbers 3, 2, 4, 5, and 1 respectively, linked sequentially by black arrows.  The bottom sequence uses orange-bordered circles with the same numbers (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) arranged sequentially and connected by black arrows. A downward-pointing grey arrow connects the node '4' in the top sequence to the node '3' in the bottom sequence, suggesting a transformation or transition between the two sequences.  The overall arrangement visually depicts a before-and-after scenario, or a process that reorders the sequence of nodes.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/sort-and-search/sort-linked-list/sort-linked-list-FE77B7AU.svg)


Given the head of a singly linked list, **sort the linked list** in ascending order.

## Intuition


Let’s start by finding a sorting algorithm that allows us to sort a linked list.


**Choosing a sorting algorithm**

We're tasked with sorting a linked list, not an array. This distinction is crucial because algorithms like quicksort rely on random access through indexing, which linked lists don't support. Merge sort is a great O(nlog⁡(n))O(n\log(n))O(nlog(n)) time option, where nnn denotes the length of the linked list, because it does not require random access and works well with linked lists, as we’ll see in this explanation.


**Merge sort**

The merge sort algorithm uses a divide and conquer strategy. At a high level, it can be broken down into three steps:

- Split the linked list into two halves:

![Image represents a directed graph illustrating a coding pattern, possibly related to state transitions or workflow.  The upper path shows a sequence of nodes (circles) numbered 3, 2, 4, 5, and 1, connected by solid black arrows indicating a directional flow from one node to the next.  A lower path mirrors part of the upper path, starting with nodes 3, 2, and 4, also connected by solid black arrows.  The key difference is that node 4 in the upper path has two gray curved arrows emanating from it, one pointing downwards to node 2 in the lower path, and another pointing downwards to node 5 in the lower path, which is then followed by node 1. This suggests a branching or conditional logic where node 4's processing can lead to two different subsequent sequences, both ultimately ending at node 1, but via different intermediate nodes (2 and 4 versus 5).  The numbers within the nodes likely represent states or steps in a process.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/sort-and-search/sort-linked-list/image-17-01-1-M2QI4XCS.svg)

- Recursively sort both halves:

![Image represents a visual depiction of the merge sort algorithm's operation on two input arrays.  The top half shows the initial input array `(3, 2, 4)` represented as three interconnected circles, each containing a number, with arrows indicating the flow of data.  The numbers are connected sequentially from left to right. Below this, a second row shows the result of an intermediate step in the merge sort, `(2, 3, 4)`, also represented by interconnected circles with arrows showing data flow.  A grey arrow connects the initial input to the intermediate result, suggesting a transformation.  The right side mirrors this structure, showing the initial input array `(5, 1)` in the top row and the intermediate result `(1, 5)` in the bottom row, again with arrows indicating data flow and a grey arrow connecting the input to the intermediate result.  The text 'merge_sort(' precedes each input array, indicating the function being applied.  The parentheses enclose the input arrays, and the closing parenthesis follows the last element of each array.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/sort-and-search/sort-linked-list/image-17-01-2-L4BVIUUA.svg)

- Merge the halves back together in a sorted manner to form a single sorted list:

![Image represents a diagram illustrating a merge operation in a coding pattern.

A curved grey arrow labeled 'merge' connects nodes '3' and '5' from the upper sequences to node '3' in the lower sequence, indicating the merging point.

We can see what the entire process looks like in the diagram below:


![Image represents a directed graph illustrating a coding pattern, possibly related to state transitions or workflow.  The graph consists of nodes, represented by circles containing numbers (1 through 5), and directed edges, represented by grey arrows connecting the nodes.  Several distinct paths are visible, with some nodes appearing multiple times in different paths.  The numbers within the nodes likely represent different states or stages in a process.  Some nodes are colored light blue, others are colored orange, suggesting a possible distinction between different types of states or stages.  The paths show the sequence of transitions between these states.  For example, one path shows a sequence of 3 \u2192 2 \u2192 4 \u2192 5 \u2192 1, while another shows 3 \u2192 2 \u2192 4, and yet another shows a loop involving nodes 2 and 3. The overall structure suggests a complex system with multiple possible state transitions and potentially parallel or branching workflows.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/sort-and-search/sort-linked-list/image-17-01-4-QVMERH4Z.svg)

This is what this process looks like as pseudocode:


```python
def merge_sort(head):
    # Split the linked list into two halves.
    second_head = split_list(head)
    # Recursively sort both halves.
    first_half_sorted = merge_sort(head)
    second_half_sorted = merge_sort(second_head)
    # Merge the sorted sublists.
    return merge(first_half_sorted, second_half_sorted)

```


Let’s discuss in more detail how to split a linked list, and how to merge two sorted linked lists.


**Splitting the linked list in half**

To split a linked list in half, we need access to its middle node because the node next to the middle node can represent the head of the second linked list:


![The image represents a linked list divided into two halves.  The linked list consists of nodes containing the numbers 3, 2, 4, 5, and 1, connected sequentially by arrows indicating the next element in the sequence.  A gray box labeled 'mid' points down to node 4, indicating this node as the midpoint of the list.  The nodes 3, 2, and 4 are enclosed under a gray line labeled 'first half,' while nodes 5 and 1 are enclosed under an orange line labeled 'second half.'  An orange box labeled 'mid.next' points down to node 5, highlighting the node immediately following the midpoint.  The arrows visually represent the flow of data through the linked list, showing the connections between consecutive nodes.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/sort-and-search/sort-linked-list/image-17-01-5-TIWMID7C.svg)

We can retrieve the middle node using the **fast and slow pointer** technique, as described in the *Linked List Midpoint* problem:


![Image represents a linked list traversal visualization illustrating a 'fast' and 'slow' pointer technique.  The linked list is depicted as a sequence of numbered nodes (3, 2, 4, 5, 1) connected by solid arrows indicating the direction of traversal. A light-blue rectangular box labeled 'slow' points to node 4, and an orange rectangular box labeled 'fast' points to node 1.  Dashed arrows show the movement of the pointers; the slow pointer moves one node at a time (3\u21922\u21924), while the fast pointer moves two nodes at a time (1\u21925\u21921). A grey dashed-line box to the right displays the condition 'fast.next == null \u2192 break,' indicating that the algorithm terminates when the fast pointer reaches the end of the list (where the next node is null).  The overall diagram demonstrates a common pattern used in algorithms like cycle detection in linked lists, where the fast pointer's faster traversal allows for efficient detection of loops or the end of the list.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/sort-and-search/sort-linked-list/image-17-01-6-IUE5HW3V.svg)

Another rectangular box labeled 'slow' points to node 4. A third rectangular box, 'second_head', points to node 5.  A dashed-line rectangle to the right displays the assignment statement 'second_head = slow.next', showing that the `second_head` pointer is being assigned the value of the `next` pointer of the `slow` pointer (which points to node 5).

A rectangular box labeled 'second_head' points to the node containing '5'. Finally, a dashed-line grey rectangle displays the condition 'slow.next = null', indicating that the next pointer of the node pointed to by 'slow' is null, signifying the end of a linked list segment.

---


Note that when the linked list is of even length, there are two middle nodes. We want the slow pointer to stop at the first middle node so we can get the head of the second half more easily. As mentioned in *Linked List Midpoint*, we can achieve this by stopping the fast pointer when `fast.next.next` is null:


![Image represents a linked list traversal visualization illustrating a fast and slow pointer approach.  The diagram shows a singly linked list with nodes numbered 3, 2, 4, and 5.  A rectangular box labeled 'slow' in light blue points to node 2 with a downward-pointing arrow, indicating the slow pointer's initial position.  Similarly, a rectangular box labeled 'fast' in orange points to node 4, showing the fast pointer's starting position. Solid arrows indicate the forward traversal of the list: node 3 points to node 2, node 2 to node 4, and node 4 to node 5.  Dashed orange and light blue curved arrows from node 3 to node 2 and from node 4 to node 2 represent the iterative movement of the fast and slow pointers, respectively.  A separate light gray box with dashed borders displays a conditional statement: 'fast.next.next == null \u2192 break,' indicating that the traversal terminates when the pointer two steps ahead of the fast pointer (fast.next.next) reaches the end of the list (null).](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/sort-and-search/sort-linked-list/image-17-01-9-R6EN3IYJ.svg)

**Merging two sorted linked lists**

First, let's consider merging two linked lists, each containing a single node, meaning they’re both inherently sorted. We merge them by placing the smaller node first, followed by the other node:


![Image represents a diagram illustrating a data flow or transformation process.  Two circles labeled '5' and '1' are positioned at the top, representing input data points or sources.  These are connected via curved, grey arrows to a lower level containing two orange-bordered circles labeled '1' and '5'. The grey arrows indicate a merging or combining of the initial data.  A solid, black arrow connects the lower-left orange circle ('1') to the lower-right orange circle ('5'), suggesting a unidirectional transformation or processing step where data from '1' is processed to produce '5'. The arrangement visually depicts a scenario where two distinct inputs ('5' and '1') are combined and then undergo a transformation resulting in a new output ('5'), potentially implying a pattern of data aggregation and subsequent modification.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/sort-and-search/sort-linked-list/image-17-01-11-7H7MSIUQ.svg)

With that established, how would we merge two longer linked lists? To do this, we can set two pointers, one at the start of each linked list, then perform the following steps:

- Compare the nodes at each pointer and add the node with the smaller value to the merged linked list.
- Advance the pointer at that node with the smaller value to the next node in its linked list.
- Repeat the above two steps until we can no longer advance either pointer.

Before discussing the final step, observe how these steps are applied to the following two sorted linked lists. We can use a dummy node to point to the head of the merged linked list:


![Image represents two linked lists being merged.  The top list consists of nodes labeled 2, 3, and 4, with a node labeled 11 pointing to node 2. The bottom list consists of nodes labeled 1 and 5, with a node labeled 12 pointing to node 1.  Arrows indicate the direction of links between nodes. A rectangular box describes the merging process:  if the value of node 11 is greater than the value of node 12, a new node (12) is added to the merged list, and the 'next' pointer of node 12 is set to point to the next node in the merged list (which is node 1 in this case).  To the right of the lists, a visual representation of this step shows a grey node labeled 'D' (likely representing a dummy node or pointer) pointing to an orange node labeled '1', illustrating the insertion of node 12 (implied, not explicitly shown) before node 1 in the merged list.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/sort-and-search/sort-linked-list/image-17-01-12-KVD7LUYH.svg)

### Complexity Analysis


**Time complexity:** The time complexity of `sort_linked_list` is O(nlog⁡(n))O(n\log(n))O(nlog(n)) because it uses merge sort. Here’s the breakdown:

- The linked list is recursively split until each sublist contains only one node. This splitting process happens about log⁡2(n)\log_2(n)log2​(n) times because each split reduces the size of the linked list by half.
- At each level, we merge the split linked lists. Merging all elements at one level takes about nnn operations.
- Since there are log⁡2(n)\log_2(n)log2​(n) levels of splitting and merging, and there are nnn operations at each level, the time complexity is O(nlog⁡(n))O(n\log(n))O(nlog(n)).

**Space complexity:** The space complexity is O(log⁡(n))O(\log(n))O(log(n)) due to the recursive call stack, which can grow up to log⁡2(n)\log_2(n)log2​(n) in height.


## Stable Sorting


Merge sort is a stable sorting algorithm. This is important in scenarios where the original order of equal elements must be preserved. For example, if we are sorting a list of nodes that share the same value, but have an additional attribute storing the time they were created, then it’s important for the relative order of these nodes to stay the same. Stability can be important for database systems; for instance, where stable sorting is required to maintain data integrity and consistency across multiple operations.
