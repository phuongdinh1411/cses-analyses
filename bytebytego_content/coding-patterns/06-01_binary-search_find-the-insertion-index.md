# Find the Insertion Index

You are given a sorted array that contains unique values, along with an integer target.

- If the array contains the target value, return its index.
- Otherwise, **return the insertion index**. This is the index where the target would be if it were inserted in order, maintaining the sorted sequence of the array.

#### Example 1:


```python
Input: nums = [1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9], target = 4
Output: 2

```


#### Example 2:


```python
Input: nums = [1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9], target = 6
Output: 4

```


Explanation: 6 would be inserted at index 4 to be positioned between 5 and 7: `[1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`.


## Intuition


The goal of this problem varies depending on whether the sorted input array contains the target value or not. If it does, we should return its index. If it doesn’t, we return its insertion index.


![Image represents two scenarios illustrating a search or insertion operation within a sorted integer array.  The left side, titled 'case 1 - target exists in array:', shows an array `[1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9]` with indices displayed below each element (0-6). The target value, 4, is highlighted in a light green circle at index 2.  The right side, titled 'case 2 - target not in array:', displays the array `[1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9]` with indices (0-6) similarly shown.  Here, the target value is 6, which is not present. A light green circle highlights the index 4, indicating where the target value *would* be inserted to maintain the sorted order. A green upward-pointing arrow labeled 'insertion index' points to this highlighted index (4) in the second array.  Both cases demonstrate how a target value's presence or absence affects the outcome of a search or insertion algorithm within a sorted array.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/binary-search/find-the-insertion-index/image-06-01-1-7DDXG5I7.svg)

When the target doesn’t exist in the array, we observe the insertion index is found at the first value in the array greater than the target, as can be seen in the second diagram above, where the first value larger than the target of 6, is 7.


Since we don’t know if the target exists in the array before we start looking for it, we can combine both cases by finding the **first value greater than or equal to the target**. This gives us a universal objective regardless of whether the target is in the array or not.


As the array is sorted, we can use **binary search** to find the desired index.


**Binary search**

In this binary search, we’re effectively looking for the first value that matches a **condition**, where the condition is that the number is greater than or equal to the target. Let’s visualize which values of the array meet this condition and which don’t:


![Image represents a visual explanation of a conditional operation applied to an array.  The top displays a conditional statement, `nums[i] >= target ?`, indicating a comparison where each element (`nums[i]`) of an array `nums` is checked against a `target` value. Below are two examples. Each example shows an array of numbers ([1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9]) and a specified `target` value (4 in the first example and 6 in the second).  Underneath each array, a corresponding array of 'F' (False) and 'T' (True) values is shown.  These boolean values represent the result of the comparison `nums[i] >= target` for each element.  Grey downward-pointing arrows connect each element in the number array to its corresponding boolean value in the result array.  In the first example (target = 4), elements less than 4 result in 'F', while elements greater than or equal to 4 result in 'T'.  Similarly, in the second example (target = 6), elements less than 6 are 'F', and those greater than or equal to 6 are 'T'.  The diagram illustrates how the conditional statement processes each array element to produce a boolean result array.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/binary-search/find-the-insertion-index/image-06-01-2-3CRPXKXO.svg)

From this diagram, we can see the value we want to find is effectively the **lower bound** of values that satisfy this condition:


![The image represents two examples illustrating a lower bound in a data structure, likely an array.  Each example shows a sequence enclosed in square brackets `[]`.  The sequences consist of elements represented by 'F' (in red) and 'T' (in green).  In both examples, a single 'T' element, highlighted within a light green circle, is positioned near the beginning of the sequence.  An upward-pointing arrow originates from below this circled 'T' and points towards it, labeled 'lower bound'.  The first example shows the sequence `[F F F T T T T T]`, while the second example shows `[F F F F F T T T]`.  The arrangement demonstrates how the 'T' element acts as a lower bound, indicating a point in the sequence where the condition represented by 'T' begins to hold true. The difference between the two examples highlights that the exact position of the lower bound can vary depending on the data.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/binary-search/find-the-insertion-index/image-06-01-3-FQPOLG6X.svg)

Note that finding the lower bound is equivalent to finding the leftmost value. With this in mind, let’s come up with an algorithm.


First, **define the search space**. If the target exists in the array, it could be located at any index within the range from 0 to n - 1. However, if the target is not in the array and is larger than all the elements, its insertion index is n. Therefore, our search space should cover all indexes in the range **[0, n]**.


To figure out how we **narrow the search space**, let’s first explore an example array that contains the target, then dive into an example where the array doesn’t contain the target.


**Target exists in the array**

Consider searching for target value 4 in the following sorted array.

Initially, the midpoint is positioned at element 5, which is a number that satisfies our condition of being greater than or equal to the target. This means the lower bound is either at this midpoint, or to its left since the lower bound is the leftmost value that satisfies the condition.


So, narrow the search space toward the left, while including the midpoint (i.e., `right = mid`):


![Image represents a visual depiction of a binary search algorithm step.  Three rectangular boxes labeled 'left,' 'mid,' and 'right' are positioned above a numerical array [1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9], with each box pointing downwards via an arrow to its corresponding index in the array.

A dashed-line rectangle to the right displays a conditional statement: 'nums[mid] \u2265 4 \u2192 right = mid,' indicating that if the value at the middle index ('nums[mid]') is greater than or equal to 4, then the 'right' index is updated to the current 'mid' index.  This illustrates a step in narrowing down the search space within the array.

Now, the midpoint is positioned at element 2. The lower bound should be a value greater than or equal to the target (4), which means the current midpoint is too small. To look for a larger value, we need to search to the right of the midpoint.


So, narrow the search space toward the right while excluding the midpoint:


![Image represents a visual depiction of a step within a binary search algorithm.  Three rectangular boxes labeled 'left,' 'mid,' and 'right' are positioned above a numerical array [1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9], with index numbers displayed below each element.  Arrows descend from 'left,' 'mid,' and 'right' pointing to the array elements 1, 2, and 5 respectively. The element at index 2 (value 4) is highlighted in light green. To the right, a dashed-line box contains a conditional statement: 'nums[mid] < 4 \u2192 left = mid + 1,' indicating that if the value at the middle index (nums[mid], which is 4 in this case) is less than 4, then the 'left' index should be updated to 'mid + 1'.  This illustrates how the algorithm adjusts the search space based on the comparison of the middle element with the target value (implicitly 4 in this example).](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/binary-search/find-the-insertion-index/image-06-01-7-U2YJETFM.svg)

Now, the midpoint is positioned at element 4, which satisfies the condition of being greater than or equal to the target. So, narrow the search space toward the left while including the midpoint:

Once the left and right pointers meet, the lower bound is located, which is the first value greater than or equal to the target. Now, we just return `left` to return this value’s index.

![Image represents a visual depiction of a step within a binary search algorithm.  The top shows three labeled boxes: 'left,' 'mid' (highlighted in cyan), and 'right.' Arrows descend from 'left' and 'mid' pointing to the numbers 7 and 8 respectively, within a numerical array [1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9].  The array's indices are shown below, with index 4 highlighted in light green, corresponding to the value 7.  An arrow descends from 'right' to the number 9 in the array. A separate, light-grey, dashed-bordered box displays the conditional logic: 'nums[mid] \u2265 6 \u2192 right = mid,' indicating that if the element at the middle index (`mid`) is greater than or equal to 6, then the 'right' index is updated to the value of `mid`. This illustrates how the algorithm adjusts the search space based on the comparison of the middle element with a target value (implicitly 6 in this case).](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/binary-search/find-the-insertion-index/image-06-01-14-VUMKKPLG.svg)

As we can see, by the end of the binary search, we’ve narrowed down the search space to a single value, identifying index 4 as the insertion index. Return `left`.

**Summary**

For clarity, let’s summarize the two main scenarios we encounter while narrowing down the search space.


Case 1: The midpoint value is greater than or equal to the target, indicating the lower bound is either at the midpoint, or to its left. In this case, we narrow the search space toward the left, ensuring the midpoint is included:


![Image represents a visual depiction of a binary search algorithm's step.  At the top, a code snippet shows the conditional statement `if nums[mid] \u2265 target: right = mid;`, indicating that if the element at the middle index (`mid`) of the array `nums` is greater than or equal to the target value, the `right` boundary of the search space is updated to `mid`. Below, two arrays, `[1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9]` and `[1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9]`, represent the initial and updated search spaces respectively.  Index numbers are shown below each element.  Boxes labeled 'left,' 'mid,' and 'right' indicate the boundaries of the search space. Arrows show the flow of information:  'left' points to the first element (index 0), 'mid' points to the element at index 3 (value 5), and 'right' initially points to the last element (index 7).  In the updated array, a dashed orange line connects the previous `right` pointer (index 7) to the new `right` pointer (index 3), visually representing the narrowing of the search space due to the condition being met. The element at `mid` (value 5) is highlighted, and the number 4 is highlighted in both arrays to emphasize its position relative to the `mid` and `left` pointers.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/binary-search/find-the-insertion-index/image-06-01-18-2JR5FV4I.svg)

Case 2: The midpoint value is less than the target, indicating the lower bound is somewhere to the right. In this case, we narrow the search space toward the right, ensuring the midpoint is excluded:


![Image represents a visual depiction of a binary search algorithm's iteration.  The top shows a code snippet: `if nums[mid] < target: left = mid + 1`, indicating a conditional statement within the algorithm where if the value at the middle index (`mid`) of the array `nums` is less than the target value, the `left` boundary is updated to `mid + 1`. Below, two arrays `[1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9]` are shown, representing the search space.  The first array shows the initial state with index numbers (0-7) beneath each element.  Arrows labeled 'left,' 'mid,' and 'right' point to the respective boundaries of the search space (1, 5, and 9 initially).  The second array illustrates the next iteration.  The `mid` pointer has moved, and the `left` pointer has shifted to the right (indicated by an orange dashed arrow) because the condition `nums[mid] < target` was true.  The `right` pointer remains unchanged.  The index numbers are again shown below the array.  The number 8 is highlighted in light green in both arrays, suggesting it might be the target value or relevant to the search.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/binary-search/find-the-insertion-index/image-06-01-19-CKCIRTJR.svg)

## Implementation


```python
from typing import List
    
def find_the_insertion_index(nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
    left, right = 0, len(nums)
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        # If the midpoint value is greater than or equal to the target, the lower
        # bound is either at the midpoint, or to its left.
        if nums[mid] >= target:
            right = mid
        # The midpoint value is less than the target, indicating the lower bound is
        # somewhere to the right.
        else:
            left = mid + 1
    return left

```


```javascript
export function find_the_insertion_index(nums, target) {
  let left = 0
  let right = nums.length
  while (left < right) {
    const mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2)
    // If the midpoint value is greater than or equal to the target, the lower
    // bound is either at the midpoint, or to its left.
    if (nums[mid] >= target) {
      right = mid
    }
    // The midpoint value is less than the target, indicating the lower bound is
    // somewhere to the right.
    else {
      left = mid + 1
    }
  }
  return left
}

```


```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class Main {
    public int find_the_insertion_index(ArrayList<Integer> nums, int target) {
        int left = 0, right = nums.size();
        while (left < right) {
            int mid = (left + right) / 2;
            // If the midpoint value is greater than or equal to the target, the lower
            // bound is either at the midpoint, or to its left.
            if (nums.get(mid) >= target) {
                right = mid;
            }
            // The midpoint value is less than the target, indicating the lower bound is
            // somewhere to the right.
            else {
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return left;
    }
}

```


### Complexity Analysis


**Time complexity:** The time complexity of `find_the_insertion_index` is O(log⁡(n))O(\log(n))O(log(n)) because it performs a binary search over a search space of size n+1n+1n+1.


**Space complexity:** The space complexity is O(1)O(1)O(1).
