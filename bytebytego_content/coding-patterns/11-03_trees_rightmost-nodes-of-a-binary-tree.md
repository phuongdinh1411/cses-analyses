# Rightmost Nodes of a Binary Tree

![Image represents a binary tree data structure where nodes are represented by circles containing numerical values.  The root node, labeled '1' and highlighted in orange, connects to two child nodes: '2' and '3', also highlighted in orange. Node '2' further branches into nodes '4' and '5', while node '3' connects to node '6', also orange. Node '4' has child nodes '8' and '9'. Node '5' connects to node '11', which is also highlighted in orange.  Arrows pointing to nodes '1', '3', '6', and '11' indicate an external input or operation targeting these specific nodes, suggesting a possible traversal or update process focused on these particular elements within the tree.  The nodes are numbered sequentially, but the orange highlighting suggests a specific subset of nodes are of particular interest or are involved in a separate process from the rest of the tree.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/trees/rightmost-nodes-of-a-binary-tree/rightmost-nodes-of-a-binary-tree-NUNL6I4H.svg)

```python
Output: [1, 3, 6, 11]

```


## Intuition


At first glance, the solution to this problem might seem as simple as traversing the rightmost branch of the tree until we reach a leaf node. But this doesn’t work. Why not? Consider the tree below. We see that traversing just the rightmost branch results in missing the rightmost node at the fourth level of the tree:


![Image represents a binary tree with nodes labeled numerically (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11).  Nodes 1, 3, and 6 are shaded gray and enclosed within a dashed oval, indicating a subset of the tree.  Arrows indicate a traversal path from node 1 to node 3, and then to node 6.  Node 11 is circled in red and a horizontal arrow points to it from the text 'missing,' highlighting its absence from the 'output' list.  To the right, the 'output' is listed as `[1 3 6]`, while the 'expected output' is `[1 3 6 11]`, demonstrating that the algorithm represented by the tree traversal only produced a subset of the expected values, specifically omitting node 11.  The tree structure shows a hierarchical relationship between the nodes, with node 1 as the root, and nodes 2 and 3 as its children. Node 2 has children 4 and 5, and node 4 has children 8 and 9. Node 3 has a child node 6, and node 5 has a child node 11.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/trees/rightmost-nodes-of-a-binary-tree/image-11-03-1-SVM4ZAVC.svg)

This means we need to consider the entire tree to attain the correct output, and not just a single branch. What would be useful is a way to traverse the tree level by level, allowing us to identify and retrieve the last (i.e., rightmost) node at each level.


We know BFS traverses nodes level by level. However, standard BFS doesn't provide explicit markers for when one level ends and another begins. In contrast, there is a type of BFS traversal that allows us to process one level at a time. This algorithm is called level-order traversal.


**Level-order traversal**

The core idea of level-order traversal is that at any level of the tree, the children of the nodes at that level comprise the next level. This means the children of level 1’s nodes make up level 2, and likewise, the children of level 2’s nodes make up level 3, and so on. To see how this works, consider the binary tree below, with the BFS queue initialized with the tree’s root node:


![Image represents a tree-like data structure, specifically a binary tree, on the left, and a queue data structure on the right. The binary tree is composed of circular nodes, each containing a single integer from 1 to 11. Node 1 is the root node, branching into nodes 2 and 3. Node 2 further branches into nodes 4 and 5, while node 3 connects to node 6. Node 4 branches into nodes 8 and 9, and node 5 connects to node 11.  The connections between nodes represent parent-child relationships.  On the right, a queue is depicted as `queue = [1]`, indicating that the queue currently contains only the integer 1, enclosed in square brackets.  There is no visible connection or information flow between the tree and the queue; they are presented as separate structures.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/trees/rightmost-nodes-of-a-binary-tree/image-11-03-2-GXXUJLBK.svg)

We know level 1 consists of only the root node. So, the children of the root make up the nodes of the second level. Let’s pop the root node off and then add its children to the queue:


![Image represents a visual explanation of Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm applied to a binary tree.  The left side shows a binary tree with a root node labeled '1' (highlighted in peach), a left child node '2', and a right child node '3'.  The nodes '2' and '3' have dashed lines indicating they might have further children, but these are not shown.  A label 'Level 1:' precedes the root node. An arrow points from a rectangular box labeled 'node' to the root node '1', suggesting data flow into the algorithm. The right side demonstrates the algorithm's process. A queue, initially containing only node '1' (in a solid circle), is shown.  A red arrow and the text 'node = queue.pop' indicate that node '1' is dequeued.  Two blue arrows, labeled 'push node.left' and 'push node.right', show the left and right children ('2' and '3', respectively, in dashed circles) being enqueued into the queue, expanding the queue to '[2, 3]'.

Since we've removed the only level 1 node from the queue and added its children, the queue now only contains the nodes of level 2. Therefore, **the size of the queue currently corresponds to the number of nodes in level 2**.

The current queue size is 2, indicating the second level has 2 nodes. So, let’s pop off the next 2 nodes in the queue and add their children to the queue:

An arrow points from a box labeled 'node' to node 2, suggesting that node 2 is currently being processed. The middle section depicts a queue data structure, initially containing only node 2.

After processing node 2, its left child (node 4) and right child (node 5) are added to the queue (represented by dashed circles), indicated by blue arrows labeled 'push node.left' and 'push node.right' respectively.

The size of the queue is 3, meaning that to process the third level, we must process the next 3 nodes.


---


To summarize this process, we start by placing the root node in the queue, where the root node represents the first level. Then, begin BFS by entering a while-loop that continues until the queue is empty, meaning all nodes in the tree have been visited. For level-order traversal:

- **Determine the level size**: Collect the current size of the queue (`level_size`) to find the number of nodes in the current level. Initially, the queue will only contain the root node, indicating the first level is of size 1.
- **Process the current level**: For each node at this level, pop it from the queue and add its children to the queue.

After processing all nodes of the current level, the queue contains all the nodes of the next level. Repeat steps 1 and 2 to process the next level. When the queue is empty, all levels have been processed.


Once we know how to traverse the tree level by level, the rightmost node at each level is obtained by collecting that level’s last node:


![Image represents a tree-like structure illustrating a coding pattern, possibly related to tree traversal or data collection.  The tree has four levels, labeled 'Level 1,' 'Level 2,' 'Level 3,' and 'Level 4.'  Each level contains nodes represented by circles, with numbers inside.  Nodes 1, 3, 6, and 11 are highlighted with an orange border.  Downward-pointing arrows indicate a traversal path, starting from node 1, then proceeding to nodes 3, 6, and finally 11.  The nodes are connected by lines representing parent-child relationships.  To the right, a list `res = [1 3 6 11]` shows the values collected during this traversal, suggesting that the algorithm collects values from the orange-highlighted nodes.

### Complexity Analysis


**Time complexity:** The time complexity of `rightmost_nodes_of_a_binary_tree` is O(n)O(n)O(n), where nnn denotes the number of nodes in the tree. This is because we process each node of the tree once during the level-order traversal.


**Space complexity:** The space complexity is O(n)O(n)O(n) due to the space taken up by the queue. The queue’s size will grow as large as the level with the most nodes. In the worst case, this occurs at the final level when all the last-level nodes are non-null, totaling approximately n/2n/2n/2 nodes. Note that the `res` array does not contribute to the space complexity.
