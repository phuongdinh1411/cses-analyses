# Flatten a Multi-Level Linked List

![Image represents a tree-like data structure visualized through numbered nodes and directed edges, illustrating a 'flattening' operation.  The structure is organized into three levels labeled 'Level 1,' 'Level 2,' and 'Level 3.' Level 1 contains nodes 1 through 5, connected sequentially by 'next' labeled arrows.  Nodes 2 and 4 have downward-pointing arrows labeled 'child,' connecting them to Level 2 nodes 6 and 8, respectively. Level 2 consists of nodes 6 through 9, with nodes 6 and 8 connected sequentially by 'next' arrows.  Nodes 7 and 9 have downward-pointing 'child' arrows connecting to Level 3 nodes 10 and 11, respectively.  A thick downward arrow labeled 'FLATTEN' indicates a transformation. Below this arrow is a flattened, single-level linked list comprising all nodes (1 through 11) connected sequentially by 'next' arrows, demonstrating the result of the flattening operation where the hierarchical structure is removed, resulting in a linear sequence.  The nodes' colors vary across levels, with Level 1 nodes in light orange, Level 2 in darker reddish-orange, and Level 3 in a yellowish-orange.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/linked-lists/flatten-a-multi-level-linked-list/flatten-a-multi-level-linked-list-ECXNUN2Q.svg)


In a multi-level linked list, each node has a `next` pointer and `child` pointer. The next pointer connects to the subsequent node in the same linked list, while the child pointer points to the head of a new linked list under it. This creates multiple levels of linked lists. If a node does not have a child list, its `child` attribute is set to null.


**Flatten** the multi-level linked list into a single-level linked list by linking the end of each level to the start of the next one.

## Intuition


Consider the two main conditions required to form the flattened linked list:

- The order of the nodes on each level needs to be preserved.
- All the nodes in one level must connect before appending nodes from the next level.

The challenge with this problem is figuring out how we process linked lists in lower levels. One strategy that might come to mind is level-order traversal using breadth-first search. However, breadth-first search usually involves the use of a queue, which would result in at least a linear space complexity. Is there a way we could merge the levels of the linked lists in place?


A key observation is that **for any level of the multi-level linked list, we have direct access to all the nodes on the next level**. This is because each node’s child node at any given level ‘L’ has direct access to nodes on the next level ‘L + 1’:


![Image represents a diagram illustrating a tree-like data structure, specifically showing the relationship between nodes at two levels, labeled 'Level L' and 'Level L + 1'.  At Level L, four black circles representing nodes are arranged horizontally, connected by arrows labeled 'next', indicating a sequential relationship.  Each of the second and fourth nodes in Level L has a downward-pointing arrow labeled 'child' connecting it to a light-blue circle in Level L + 1. These light-blue circles, also representing nodes, are arranged horizontally and connected by arrows labeled 'next', mirroring the structure of Level L. A gray horizontal line with tick marks underneath Level L + 1 visually groups the nodes at that level, and the text 'Level L + 1 nodes are accessible from level L' clarifies that the lower-level nodes are children of, and therefore accessible from, the upper-level nodes.  The overall structure demonstrates a hierarchical relationship where nodes at Level L can access nodes at Level L + 1 through the 'child' connections.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/linked-lists/flatten-a-multi-level-linked-list/image-03-06-1-F3VENPE7.svg)

How can we connect the nodes on level ‘L + 1’ to the end of level ‘L’? Since we have access to the nodes at the next level from the current level’s child pointers, we can append each child linked list to the end of the current level, which effectively merges these two levels into one.


![Image represents a diagram illustrating a linked list data structure with nested lists.  The diagram shows a sequence of five solid-line circles connected by solid-line arrows labeled 'next,' representing nodes in a primary linked list. The third and fourth nodes have downward-pointing arrows labeled 'child,' connecting them to separate light-blue rectangular boxes. Each box contains a smaller linked list of two nodes (solid-line circles) connected by a 'next' arrow.  The primary list then continues with two additional nodes represented by dashed-line circles within a light-blue rectangle, also connected by 'next' arrows.  Finally, a light-blue upward-pointing arrow connects the bottom of each of the child linked lists to the dashed-line nodes in the primary list, indicating a hierarchical relationship where the child lists are appended to the main list.  The overall structure depicts a tree-like organization where the main list acts as the parent, and the child lists are sub-lists branching from specific nodes.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/linked-lists/flatten-a-multi-level-linked-list/image-03-06-2-CLLVBZ6P.svg)

So, with all the nodes on level ‘L + 1’ appended to level ‘L’, we can continue this process by appending nodes from level ‘L + 2’ to level ‘L + 1’, and so on.


Now that we have a high-level idea about what we should do, let’s try this strategy on the following example:


![Image represents a directed acyclic graph illustrating a coding pattern, possibly a tree-like data structure.  The graph is composed of ten nodes, numbered 1 through 10, represented as circles with varying shades of orange and brown.  Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 are lighter orange, while nodes 5, 6, 7, and 8 are darker brown. Nodes 9 and 10 are a lighter orange than nodes 1-4.  Arrows connect the nodes, indicating direction.  Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 are linked horizontally by arrows labeled 'next,' forming a sequence. Node 1 has a downward arrow labeled 'child' connecting it to node 5, and node 4 has a downward arrow labeled 'child' connecting it to node 7. Similarly, nodes 5 and 6 are linked horizontally by an arrow labeled 'next,' with node 6 having a downward arrow labeled 'child' connecting it to node 9.  Nodes 7 and 8 are linked horizontally by an arrow labeled 'next,' with node 7 having a downward arrow labeled 'child' connecting it to node 10. The label 'head: 1' indicates node 1 as the starting point or root of the structure.  The overall structure suggests a combination of linked lists (horizontal 'next' connections) and a tree-like hierarchy (vertical 'child' connections).](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/linked-lists/flatten-a-multi-level-linked-list/image-03-06-3-LFG4TFC7.svg)

We’ll start by appending level 2’s nodes to the end of level 1. Before we can do this, we would need a reference to level 1’s tail node so we can easily add nodes to the end of the linked list. To set this reference, we'll create a tail pointer and advance it through level 1's linked list until it reaches the last node, which happens when tail.next is equal to null:


![Image represents a singly linked list data structure.  The list is labeled 'head:' and consists of four nodes, each represented by an orange circle containing a numerical value (1, 2, 3, and 4). Each node, except the last, has a solid black arrow labeled 'next' pointing to the subsequent node, indicating the directional flow of data within the list.  Dashed light-blue curved arrows connect each node to the `tail` which is represented by a light-blue rectangular box containing the text 'tail'. These dashed arrows visually represent the connection to the tail, but don't imply a direct data flow in the same way as the 'next' arrows.

Now, let’s add the child linked lists (5 → 6 and 7 → 8) to the tail node. We must keep the tail pointer fixed at the end of the linked list, so let’s introduce a separate pointer, `curr`, to traverse the linked list. Whenever `curr` encounters a node with a child node that isn’t null, we know we’ve found a child linked list. In the example, the first node (node 1) has a child linked list, which we want to add to the tail node:


![Image represents a linked list data structure illustrating a coding pattern.  The main list is composed of orange-filled nodes (1, 2, 3, 4) connected by arrows labeled 'next,' indicating the directional flow of data.

Before incrementing `curr` to find the next node with a child linked list, we need to readjust the position of the tail pointer so it’s pointing at the last node of the newly extended linked list (node 6 in this case). Again, we can do this by iterating the tail pointer until its next node is null:

With the tail pointer now repositioned, we can continue this process of:

- Finding the next node with a child linked list using the `curr` pointer.
- Adding the child linked list to the tail node.
- Advancing the tail pointer to the last node of the flattened linked list.

![Image represents a linked list data structure illustrating the process of adding a node to the tail.

A new node, '10', colored orange and enclosed in a green box, is being added to the tail, indicated by the text 'add to tail' and an arrow from node 8 to node 10.  The final node in the main list is represented by a dashed-line box, indicating that it is the current end of the list before the addition of node 10.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/linked-lists/flatten-a-multi-level-linked-list/image-03-06-11-X6FNWG3F.svg)


![Image represents a linked list data structure illustrating the process of adding a node to the tail.  The list begins with a 'head' node labeled '1', colored orange, connected via 'next' pointers to subsequent nodes (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9) with colors transitioning from orange to dark-red and then orange again.  Nodes 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7 are also colored orange, while 5 is dark-red.  Each node, except the last, points to the next node in the sequence.  Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7 have downward-pointing arrows labeled 'child' connecting them to secondary linked lists (5-6, 7-8, and 9 respectively), represented by lighter gray nodes.  A 'curr' pointer points to node 8, and a 'tail' pointer points to node 9.  A new node, '10', colored orange and enclosed in a green box, is being added to the tail, indicated by the text 'add to tail' and an arrow from node 8 to node 10.

![Image represents a linked list data structure with nodes numbered 1 through 10.  The nodes are connected by directed edges labeled 'next,' indicating the sequential order. Nodes 1 through 4 are colored light orange, nodes 5 through 7 are dark red, and nodes 8 through 10 are light orange.  The list starts with a 'head' pointer pointing to node 1.  Each node (except the last) points to the next node in the sequence via its 'next' pointer.  Additionally, nodes 4, 6, and 8 have downward-pointing edges labeled 'child,' each connecting to a separate, smaller linked list containing nodes 5-6, 7-8, and 9-10 respectively. These child lists also use 'next' pointers to link their nodes. A 'curr' pointer points to node 8, and a 'tail' pointer points to node 10, indicating current position and the end of the main list.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/linked-lists/flatten-a-multi-level-linked-list/image-03-06-12-5ZREBQ6N.svg)

After the process is complete, we can return head, which is the head of the flattened linked list.


One last important detail to mention is that after appending any child linked list to the tail, we should nullify the `child` attribute to ensure the linked list is fully flattened.


## Implementation


The definition of the `MultiLevelListNode` class is provided below:


```python
class MultiLevelListNode:
    def __init__(self, val, next, child):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next
        self.child = child

```


```javascript
class MultiLevelListNode {
  constructor(val = null, next = null, child = null) {
    this.val = val
    this.next = next
    this.child = child
  }
}

```


```java
public class MultiLevelListNode<T> {
    T val;
    MultiLevelListNode<T> next;
    MultiLevelListNode<T> child;
}

```


```python
from ds import MultiLevelListNode
   
def flatten_multi_level_list(head: MultiLevelListNode) -> MultiLevelListNode:
    if not head:
        return None
    tail = head
    # Find the tail of the linked list at the first level.
    while tail.next:
        tail = tail.next
    curr = head
    # Process each node at the current level. If a node has a child linked list,
    # append it to the tail and then update the tail to the end of the extended linked
    # list. Continue until all nodes at the current level are processed.
    while curr:
        if curr.child:
            tail.next = curr.child
            curr.child = None
            while tail.next:
                tail = tail.next
        curr = curr.next
    return head

```


```javascript
import { MultiLevelListNode } from './ds.js'

export function flatten_multi_level_list(head) {
  if (!head) {
    return null
  }
  let tail = head
  // Find the tail of the linked list at the first level.
  while (tail.next) {
    tail = tail.next
  }
  let curr = head
  // Process each node at the current level. If a node has a child linked list,
  // append it to the tail and then update the tail to the end of the extended
  // linked list. Continue until all nodes at the current level are processed.
  while (curr) {
    if (curr.child) {
      tail.next = curr.child
      // Disconnect the child linked list from the current node.
      curr.child = null
      while (tail.next) {
        tail = tail.next
      }
    }
    curr = curr.next
  }
  return head
}

```


```java
public class Main {
    public static MultiLevelListNode flatten_multi_level_list(MultiLevelListNode head) {
        if (head == null) {
            return null;
        }
        MultiLevelListNode tail = head;
        // Find the tail of the linked list at the first level.
        while (tail.next != null) {
            tail = tail.next;
        }
        MultiLevelListNode curr = head;
        // Process each node at the current level. If a node has a child linked list,
        // append it to the tail and then update the tail to the end of the extended linked
        // list. Continue until all nodes at the current level are processed.
        while (curr != null) {
            if (curr.child != null) {
                tail.next = curr.child;
                curr.child = null;
                while (tail.next != null) {
                    tail = tail.next;
                }
            }
            curr = curr.next;
        }
        return head;
    }
}

```


### Complexity Analysis


**Time complexity:** The time complexity of `flatten_multi_level_list` is O(n)O(n)O(n), where nnn denotes the number of nodes in the multi-level linked list. This is because we iterate through each node in the multi-level linked list at most twice: once to iterate tail and once to iterate `curr`.


**Space complexity:** We only allocated a constant number of variables, so the space complexity is O(1)O(1)O(1).
