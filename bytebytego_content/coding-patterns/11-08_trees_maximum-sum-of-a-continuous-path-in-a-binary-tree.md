# Maximum Sum of a Continuous Path in a Binary Tree

![Image represents a binary tree structure where nodes contain numerical values.  The root node, at the top, is labeled '5'.  This root node branches into two child nodes: '-10' on the left and '8' on the right. The '-10' node further branches into '1' and '-7', which in turn branch into '11' and '-1' respectively. The '8' node branches into '9' and '7'. The '7' node further branches into '6' and '-3'.  A peach-colored highlight encompasses the nodes '8', '9', '7', '6', and '-3'. To the right of this highlighted section, a calculation is shown: 'sum = 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 = 30', indicating a summation of the values within the highlighted subtree.

Return the **maximum sum of a continuous path** in a binary tree. A path is defined by the following characteristics:

- Consists of a sequence of nodes that can begin and end at any node in the tree.
- Each consecutive pair of nodes in the sequence is connected by an edge.
- The path must be a **single continuous sequence** of nodes that doesn't split into multiple paths.

#### Example:


![Image represents a binary tree structure where nodes contain numerical values.  The root node, at the top, is labeled '5'.  This root node branches into two child nodes: '-10' on the left and '8' on the right. The '-10' node further branches into '1' and '-7', which in turn branch into '11' and '-1' respectively. The '8' node branches into '9' and '7'. The '7' node further branches into '6' and '-3'.  A peach-colored highlight encompasses the nodes '8', '9', '7', '6', and '-3'. To the right of this highlighted section, a calculation is shown: 'sum = 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 = 30', indicating a summation of the values within the highlighted subtree.

Output: 30

```


#### Constraints:

- The tree contains at least one node.

## Intuition


Let’s first understand what a path is in a binary tree. An important thing to note is that all paths have a root node. Consider the following binary tree:


![Image represents a binary tree data structure.  The root node, at the top, contains the value '5'.  This root node connects to two child nodes: a left child node with the value '-10' and a right child node with the value '8'.  The left child node ('-10') further branches into two child nodes: a left child with the value '1' and a right child with the value '-7'. The '1' node has a single left child node with the value '11'. The '-7' node has a single left child node with the value '-1'. The right child node ('8') also branches into two child nodes: a left child with the value '9' and a right child with the value '7'. The '7' node has two child nodes: a left child with the value '6' and a right child with the value '-3'.  All nodes are represented as circles containing their respective integer values. The connections between nodes represent parent-child relationships within the tree structure, indicating hierarchical organization of the data.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/trees/maximum-sum-of-a-continuous-path-in-a-binary-tree/image-11-08-1-X53CH2PJ.svg)

Every path that exists in this tree has a corresponding root node, as shown in the three examples below:


![Image represents four binary trees, each illustrating a different stage in identifying a root-to-leaf path.  The top-left tree is a complete binary tree with root node '5', branching into '-10' and '8'.  '-10' further branches into '1' and '-7', with '1' having a child node '11' and '-7' having '-1'. '8' branches into '9' and '7', with '7' having children '6' and '-3'.  A peach-colored highlight indicates a path from the root to a leaf node, starting at node '8' in this instance, with an orange arrow labeled 'root of path' pointing to it. The bottom-left tree shows the same structure, but the highlighted path originates at '-10'. The top-right and bottom-right trees are identical to the left-side trees, but the highlighted paths are different, illustrating different possible root-to-leaf paths within the same tree structure.  Each highlighted path visually emphasizes a specific sequence of nodes from the root to a leaf node in the binary tree.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/trees/maximum-sum-of-a-continuous-path-in-a-binary-tree/image-11-08-2-BAEE2OAU.svg)

Inversely, this means that every node in the tree is the root of some path(s). For example, node 7 in the tree below is the root of four paths. The largest sum rooting from node 7 is 13:


![Image represents two binary trees illustrating a tree traversal algorithm, likely for finding a subset of nodes that sums to a target value.  Both trees have a root node labeled '5'.  Each root node branches to two child nodes:  the left branch connects to a node labeled '-10', and the right branch connects to a node labeled '8'.  The '-10' node further branches to nodes '1' and '-7', with '1' branching to '11' and '-7' branching to '-1'. The '8' node branches to '9' and '7'.  In the left tree, the '7' node is highlighted in peach and branches to '6' and '-3', with the text 'sum = 7' indicating the sum of these three nodes (7 + 6 + -3).  The right tree is identical to the left, except the '7', '6', and '-3' nodes are highlighted in peach, and a rectangular box labeled 'sum = 13' is placed next to them, indicating the sum of these three nodes (7 + 6 + 0).

So, to find the maximum path sum, we calculate the maximum sum rooting from each node and return the largest of these sums.


**Calculating the maximum path sum at any node**

Let’s try adopting a recursive strategy for this. Consider the root node of our example. The maximum sum of a path rooting from node 5 involves the maximum gain we can attain from its left subtree and its right subtree.


![Image represents a binary tree illustrating the concept of finding the maximum path sum starting from a root node (node 5).  The tree is composed of nodes containing integer values. Node 5 is the root, branching to a left subtree (highlighted in light blue) and a right subtree (highlighted in light purple). The left subtree consists of nodes -10, 1, -7, 11, and -1, while the right subtree contains nodes 8, 9, 7, 6, and -3.  Each node is connected to its parent and children nodes via lines.  The formula '5 + (max from left) + (max from right)' is displayed above the tree, indicating that the maximum path sum from node 5 is calculated by adding the value of node 5 to the maximum path sum from its left subtree and the maximum path sum from its right subtree.  The subtrees are labeled 'left' and 'right' for clarity. A small box labeled 'node' points to node 5, indicating that the calculation starts from this node.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/trees/maximum-sum-of-a-continuous-path-in-a-binary-tree/image-11-08-5-XFWCISNW.svg)

Which sums do we expect node 5’s left and right subtrees to return? Consider what happens when the maximum path sums of these subtrees are returned to node 5:


![Image represents a binary tree with a root node labeled '5'.  A light-blue shaded area highlights the left subtree, showing a path from node '-10' to node '1' and finally to node '11', with the text 'maximum path of left subtree (sum = 2)' indicating the maximum path sum within this subtree.  Similarly, a light-purple shaded area highlights the right subtree, showing a path from node '8' to node '7', then to nodes '6' and '-3', with the text 'maximum path of right subtree (sum = 30)' indicating its maximum path sum.  A dashed cyan arrow points from a box labeled 'node' to the root node '5', indicating the starting point of the algorithm.  Dashed magenta arrows connect the root node '5' to the maximum paths of both subtrees.

As we can see, when we received the maximum path sum from a recursive call made to node 8, we received the sum of a path with multiple branches. This results in an invalid path formed at node 5.


Below, we can see what we actually want. The sums of the two paths returned here correctly give us the maximum path sum rooting from node 5:

The difference between the valid and invalid paths above lies in the type of path returned by the recursive call to node 8. We can see this difference clearly in the diagram below.

- In the left diagram below, an invalid path is formed at node 5 because at node 8, we return node 8’s maximum path sum, which is from a path with two branches.
- In the right diagram, a valid path is formed at node 5 because we return the largest sum of a path with a single branch.

This observation highlights that we can’t just return the maximum path sum of a node. So, let’s have a closer look at which path sum we should return, instead.


**Identifying the value returned during recursion**

Consider node 8 from the above example. The maximum path sum rooting from node 8 is 30. We know from the discussion above that we can’t just return this maximum path sum value:


![Image represents a binary tree structure with nodes containing numerical values and a calculation demonstrating a maximum sum computation.  A light-grey node labeled '5' is connected via a dashed line to a peach-colored node labeled '8'. A rectangular box labeled 'node' indicates a data flow from the box to node '8'. Node '8' is connected to a peach-colored node '9' and a peach-colored node '7'. Node '7' is further connected to a peach-colored node '6' and a light-grey node '-3'.  A calculation to the right shows `max_sum = node.val + left_sum + right_sum`, with `node.val` being 8, `left_sum` being 9, and `right_sum` being 13, resulting in a `max_sum` of 30.  However, a red 'X' marks the `return max_sum` statement, suggesting an error or an incorrect approach in the calculation or algorithm. The dashed line from node '5' to node '8' implies a potential recursive call or traversal within a tree-processing algorithm.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/trees/maximum-sum-of-a-continuous-path-in-a-binary-tree/image-11-08-11-OTSRFTHZ.svg)

The dashed line from node '5' to node '8' implies a potential recursive call or traversal within a tree-processing algorithm.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/trees/maximum-sum-of-a-continuous-path-in-a-binary-tree/image-11-08-11-OTSRFTHZ.svg)


We know we need to make sure we **return a single, continuous path** from node 8. This would mean **returning a path with node 8 as an end point**, which leaves us with two main choices for values we could return:

Between the above two paths, we just return whichever of their sums is larger. Therefore, our return statement is:


> `return node.val + max(left_sum, right_sum)`


Now that we’re getting single continuous path sums from the left and right subtrees, **the maximum path sum rooting from a node** can be calculated using **`node.val + left_sum + right_sum`**. This is done separately from the return statement.


The maximum path sum of the entire tree is found by keeping track of the largest path sum formed at every node.


**Handling negative path sums**

One final thing to note is that we shouldn’t include the values of `left_sum` or `right_sum` if either is negative, as they wouldn’t contribute to a maximum sum. We can do this by setting their values to 0 if they’re negative, which is the same as excluding the left or right path from the sum.


## Implementation


```python
from ds import TreeNode
    
max_sum = float('-inf')
    
def max_path_sum(root: TreeNode) -> int:
   global max_sum
   max_path_sum_helper(root)
   return max_sum
    
def max_path_sum_helper(node: TreeNode) -> int:
   global max_sum
   # Base case: null nodes have no path sum.
   if not node:
       return 0
   # Collect the maximum gain we can attain from the left and right subtrees, setting
   # them to 0 if they’re negative.
   left_sum = max(max_path_sum_helper(node.left), 0)
   right_sum = max(max_path_sum_helper(node.right), 0)
   # Update the overall maximum path sum if the current path sum is larger.
   max_sum = max(max_sum, node.val + left_sum + right_sum)
   # Return the maximum sum of a single, continuous path with the current node as an
   # endpoint.
   return node.val + max(left_sum, right_sum)

```


```javascript
import { TreeNode } from './ds.js'

let maxSum = -Infinity

export function max_path_sum(root) {
  maxSum = -Infinity
  maxPathSumHelper(root)
  return maxSum
}

function maxPathSumHelper(node) {
  // Base case: null nodes have no path sum.
  if (!node) return 0
  // Collect the maximum gain we can attain from the left and right subtrees,
  // setting them to 0 if they’re negative.
  const leftSum = Math.max(maxPathSumHelper(node.left), 0)
  const rightSum = Math.max(maxPathSumHelper(node.right), 0)

  // Update the overall maximum path sum if the current path sum is larger.
  maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, node.val + leftSum + rightSum)
  // Return the maximum sum of a single, continuous path with the current node
  // as an endpoint.
  return node.val + Math.max(leftSum, rightSum)
}

```


```java
import core.BinaryTree.TreeNode;

class Main {
    private static int maxSum = Integer.MIN_VALUE;

    public static int max_path_sum(TreeNode<Integer> root) {
        // Start the recursive traversal and return the maximum path sum.
        max_path_sum_helper(root);
        return maxSum;
    }

    private static int max_path_sum_helper(TreeNode<Integer> node) {
        // Base case: null nodes have no path sum.
        if (node == null) {
            return 0;
        }
        // Collect the maximum gain we can attain from the left and right subtrees, setting
        // them to 0 if they’re negative.
        int leftSum = Math.max(max_path_sum_helper(node.left), 0);
        int rightSum = Math.max(max_path_sum_helper(node.right), 0);
        // Update the overall maximum path sum if the current path sum is larger.
        maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, node.val + leftSum + rightSum);
        // Return the maximum sum of a single, continuous path with the current node as an
        // endpoint.
        return node.val + Math.max(leftSum, rightSum);
    }
}

```


### Complexity Analysis


**Time complexity:** The time complexity of `max_path_sum` is O(n)O(n)O(n), where nnn denotes the number of nodes in the tree. This is because it traverses each node of the tree once.


**Space complexity:** The space complexity is O(n)O(n)O(n) due to the space taken up by the recursive call stack, which can grow as large as the height of the binary tree. The largest possible height of a binary tree is nnn.
