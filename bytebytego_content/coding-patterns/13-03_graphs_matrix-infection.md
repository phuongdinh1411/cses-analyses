# Matrix Infection

![Image represents a four-stage visualization of a data transformation process, possibly illustrating a coding pattern like a wave propagation or diffusion algorithm.  Each stage is labeled 'second 0,' 'second 1,' 'second 2,' and 'second 3,' suggesting a time sequence.  Each stage displays a 3x4 grid of cells.  Initially (second 0), a single cell in the center-right contains the value '2', while all other cells contain '0' or '1'.  Subsequent stages show the '2' value propagating to adjacent cells.  Arrows in 'second 1' indicate the direction of this propagation (up and down). In 'second 2' and 'second 3', the '2' value continues to spread horizontally, with '2 \u2190 2' indicating the merging or interaction of two '2' values.  The color of the cells changes to a light peach color as they acquire the '2' value, visually highlighting the propagation. The overall arrangement demonstrates a step-by-step evolution of the data within the grid over time, illustrating a specific pattern of data movement and transformation.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/graphs/matrix-infection/matrix-infection-BXMNB3IO.svg)


You are given a matrix where each cell is either:


`0`: Empty

`1`: Uninfected

`2`: Infected


With each passing second, every infected cell (2) infects its uninfected neighboring cells (1) that are 4-directionally adjacent. Determine the number of seconds required **for all uninfected cells to become infected**. If this is impossible, return ‐1.

## Intuition


Let’s begin tackling this problem by considering a simple case where the initial matrix contains only one infected cell.


**Matrix with one infected cell**

Consider the following matrix, containing just one 2:


![Image represents a 3x4 grid, enclosed by a bold black border, containing numerical values.  The grid is divided into twelve cells, each displaying either a '0' (greyed out) or a '1' (in bold black font), except for one cell in the center-right which contains a '2' (in bold black font) and is highlighted with a light peach/beige background.  The arrangement of the numbers appears somewhat random, with no immediately apparent pattern or sequence.  There are no connections or arrows depicted between the cells, and no additional information such as labels, URLs, or parameters are present within the image itself. The numbers within the grid are simply presented as data points within the cells of the matrix.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/graphs/matrix-infection/image-13-03-1-K3SOEBD4.svg)

An observation is that each infected (2) and uninfected (1) cell can be considered as nodes in a graph, where edges exist between cells that are 4-directionally adjacent. Therefore, we can visualize these cells as a connected graph:


![Image represents a visual comparison of two data representations.  On the left, a 3x3 matrix is shown, containing numerical values.  The top row displays '1', '1', and '1', while the second row shows '0', '0', and a highlighted '2' in a peach-colored cell. The bottom row contains '0', '1', and '1'.  The '0' values are displayed in a lighter gray font.  A curly brace connects this matrix to a graph on the right. This graph is composed of several nodes, each represented by a circle containing a numerical value.  Three nodes labeled '1' are connected horizontally in a row at the top.  Below this, a central node labeled '2' is highlighted in orange, connected to the rightmost '1' of the top row, and to a '1' node to its right and two '1' nodes below it, forming a T-shape.  The connections between the nodes are represented by lines, indicating relationships or flows between the data points. The overall image illustrates a possible transformation or mapping between a matrix representation and a graph representation of the same underlying data, with the highlighted '2' in the matrix corresponding to the central highlighted '2' node in the graph.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/graphs/matrix-infection/image-13-03-2-WLG5663H.svg)

This helps us think about this problem as a graph traversal problem. Which traversal algorithm will allow us to simulate the infection process? To find out, let’s observe how cells get infected each second.

After the first second, the adjacent uninfected neighbors of the first infected cell become infected. These cells are a distance of 1 away from the initially infected cell:


![Image represents a visual comparison of a 2D array and a graph.  The left side shows a 3x3 array where cells contain the numbers 1, 2, and 0. A 2x2 sub-array in the rightmost column and middle rows is highlighted in peach, containing the numbers 2. Arrows within this sub-array indicate movement: an upward arrow from the central '2' to the '2' above it, and a downward arrow from the central '2' to the '2' below it, and a rightward arrow from the central '2' to another '2' to its right. The right side depicts a directed graph.  Three nodes labeled '1' are connected to three nodes labeled '2', all of which are colored peach.  The '2' nodes are arranged vertically.  The connections between '1' and '2' nodes are represented by lines, and each connection is labeled 'dist = 1,' indicating a distance of 1 between connected nodes.  The peach-colored '2' nodes are also connected to each other with arrows, mirroring the movement shown in the array's peach sub-array, with the rightmost '2' node highlighted with a thicker orange border.  The graph visually represents the movement pattern shown in the array's highlighted section.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/graphs/matrix-infection/image-13-03-3-EECXD6O2.svg)

One second later, the neighbors of the most recently infected cells get infected. These cells are a distance of 2 from the initial infected cell:

The left side shows a 3x4 matrix.  The top-left cell contains '1', while several cells contain '2' and others contain '0'.  The '2' values are shaded a light peach color, and arrows indicate a potential flow or relationship between two adjacent '2' values. The right side displays a graph with nodes representing values and edges representing connections.  The top graph section shows a node labeled '1' connected to a node labeled '2' (highlighted in orange), which is further connected to another node labeled '2' (not highlighted).

As we can see, the outward expansion from the initially infected cell is similar to how level-order traversal works in a tree, where each level represents nodes that are at a specific distance from the initially infected node.


So, let’s perform a level-order traversal to infect cells, starting at the infected cell. **Each level that gets traversed corresponds to 1-second passing in the infection process**.


![Image represents a comparison of two data structures representing the same information.  On the left, a 3x4 matrix is shown, labeled 'second 0' at the top.  The matrix contains numerical values; most cells contain '0' or '1', but one cell in the center is highlighted in a light peach color and contains the value '2'.  On the right, a graph is presented, also labeled 'second 0' near a node. This graph consists of seven circular nodes, each containing the number '1' except for one central node highlighted in orange, which contains the number '2'.  The nodes are connected by lines representing edges. Three nodes form a horizontal line, connected to the central '2' node, which is further connected to another node containing '1' and a pair of nodes at the bottom. The arrangement of the '1's in the graph mirrors the arrangement of '1's in the matrix, with the central '2' in both structures corresponding to the highlighted '2' in the matrix.  The overall image likely illustrates a data transformation or representation of the same data in two different formats, possibly demonstrating a matrix-to-graph conversion or a similar concept within the context of coding patterns.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/graphs/matrix-infection/image-13-03-5-PHIJ7Q5F.svg)

Regarding the implementation of this traversal, we know that level-order traversal is a modified version of BFS. So, we use a queue to implement this traversal. If you're unfamiliar with how this works, review the *Rightmost Nodes of a Binary Tree* problem from the *Tree* chapter, which implements a level-order traversal on a binary tree.


Now, let’s consider how we would handle a matrix which initially contains multiple infected cells.


**Matrix with multiple infected cells**

Consider the following example and its corresponding graph visualization:


![Image represents a visual comparison of two data structure representations.  On the left, a 3x3 matrix is shown, containing numerical values.  Specifically, the matrix displays the numbers 1, 2, and 0, with the '2' values highlighted in a light peach color. The matrix is enclosed in a bold black border. To the right of the matrix, a large grey curly brace indicates a transformation or mapping.  Following the brace are two graphs, each composed of nodes connected by edges.  The nodes are circles containing the numbers 1 and 2; nodes with the number '2' are highlighted with an orange border. The first graph is a vertical chain of three nodes connected sequentially, with the top and bottom nodes connected to a '2' node each, forming a 'U' shape. The second graph is a 'T' shape, with a central node connected to a node above and two nodes below, one of which is a '2' node.  The graphs visually represent alternative ways to structure or interpret the data presented in the matrix, potentially illustrating a concept like adjacency matrices or graph representations of data.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/graphs/matrix-infection/image-13-03-9-5E66COPW.svg)

In this example, multiple cells are initially infected, meaning there are multiple cells at level 0 of the traversal.


To handle this, we use a pattern known as **multi-source BFS**. Instead of adding just one cell to the queue before performing level-order traversal, we add every initially infected cell to the queue. This way, the traversal starts with all initially infected cells as level 0, allowing the infection process to begin simultaneously from multiple starting points:


![Image represents a 3x5 matrix where each cell contains a numerical value.  The rows are labeled 0, 1, and 2, and the columns are labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.  The matrix cells contain the numbers 0, 1, and 2, with some cells highlighted in a light peach color.  These highlighted cells represent elements that are part of a queue, which is defined to the right of the matrix as `queue = [(0, 1) (2, 1) (2, 4)]`.  This queue notation indicates that the coordinates (row, column) of the highlighted cells are (0,1), (2,1), and (2,4).  The numbers within the matrix cells themselves do not appear to directly relate to the queue's structure; rather, the queue identifies specific cell locations within the matrix.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/graphs/matrix-infection/image-13-03-10-CXCNQ32R.svg)

![Image represents a comparison of two data structure representations.  On the left, a 3x4 matrix is shown, with cells containing numerical values.  The top-left cell contains '1', followed by '2' in the adjacent cell, then '1', and finally '0' in the last cell of the top row. The second row contains '1', '0', '0', and '1'. The bottom row shows '1', '2', '0', and '2'.  Cells containing '2' are highlighted in a light peach color. The entire matrix is labeled 'second 0' at the top. On the right, three separate graphs are depicted, each consisting of interconnected nodes.  The nodes are circles containing the numbers '1' or '2'.  Nodes containing '2' are highlighted in orange. The first graph shows a vertical chain of three '1' nodes, with the bottom '1' node connected to an orange '2' node.  The top '1' node is connected to another '1' node, which is connected to an orange '2' node. The second graph is a simple chain of a '1' node connected to a '1' node, which is connected to an orange '2' node. The third graph is a vertical chain of a '1' node connected to a '1' node, which is connected to an orange '2' node. Each of these graphs is also labeled 'second 0' near the orange '2' node.

**Unreachable uninfected cells**

It's important to keep in mind that it's not always possible to infect all uninfected cells. We could encounter situations where it's impossible to reach an uninfected cell, such as in the following example:


![The image represents a visual explanation of a coding pattern, likely related to a 2D array or matrix manipulation.  A 3x3 matrix is shown, with each cell containing a numerical value. The top-middle cell (row 1, column 2) contains the number '2' and is highlighted with a light peach/beige color, suggesting a focus or initial state. The other cells in the first row contain '1' and '1', while the remaining cells contain '0', except for the bottom-left cell (row 3, column 1), which contains '1'. A horizontal arrow points from the text 'this will never be infected' to the bottom-left cell containing '1'. This illustrates that despite the initial state of the matrix, the cell represented by the '1' in the bottom-left corner will remain unchanged, or 'never be infected,' implying a specific algorithm or condition prevents its modification. The overall structure suggests a demonstration of data immutability or a specific algorithm's behavior within a matrix context.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/graphs/matrix-infection/image-13-03-14-6TO6KGIZ.svg)

One way to account for this is to search through the matrix after level-order traversal and check if any 1s remain. However, there’s a cleaner way to accomplish this. First, in the loop where we search for all the level 0 infected cells, we can also count how many 1s there are:


![Image represents a 3x3 matrix alongside a queue and a count. The matrix is indexed with row and column numbers from 0 to 2.  The matrix cells contain integers; a '2' is highlighted in a peach/light-orange color at row 0, column 1.  Other cells contain '1's and '0's. To the right of the matrix, a queue is defined as `queue = [(0, 1)]`, representing a coordinate pair (row, column) indicating the position of the highlighted '2'.  Finally, a count `ones = 3` indicates the total number of '1's present within the matrix.  The matrix, queue, and count likely represent an intermediate state in an algorithm, possibly related to searching or processing a 2D array.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/graphs/matrix-infection/image-13-03-15-DTJ5KJRQ.svg)

Then, as we perform the level-order traversal, we can decrement this count for each uninfected cell we infect. This way, the value of this count after the traversal will represent the number of cells that remained uninfected. We return -1 if this count is greater than 0:


![Image represents a 3x3 matrix with numerical values and arrows, alongside a decision box.  The matrix is labeled with row and column indices from 0 to 2. The top row (index 0) contains the values 2, 2, and 2, highlighted in a light peach color, with bidirectional arrows indicating movement or comparison between the adjacent '2's. The second row (index 1) contains only zeros (0), and the third row (index 2) contains a '1' in the first column and zeros in the remaining columns.  To the right of the matrix is a dashed-line box containing a condition: 'ones = 1 > 0 \u2192 return -1'. This box indicates a decision-making process; if the number of 'ones' in the matrix is greater than 0, the function returns a value of -1.  The matrix likely represents data or a state within a program, and the decision box shows a conditional return statement based on the data within the matrix.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/graphs/matrix-infection/image-13-03-16-4L3SJ6V7.svg)

### Complexity Analysis


**Time complexity:** The time complexity of `matrix_infection` is O(m⋅n)O(m\cdot n)O(m⋅n), where mmm denotes the number of rows, and nnn denotes the number of columns. This is because in the worst case, every cell in the matrix is explored during level-order traversal.


**Space complexity:** The space complexity is O(m⋅n)O(m\cdot n)O(m⋅n), primarily due to the queue, which can store up to m⋅nm\cdot nm⋅n cells.
