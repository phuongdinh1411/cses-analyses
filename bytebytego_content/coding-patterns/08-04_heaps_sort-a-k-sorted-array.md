# Sort a K-Sorted Array

Given an integer array where each element is at most `k` positions away from its sorted position, **sort the array** in a non-decreasing order.


#### Example:


```python
Input: nums = [5, 1, 9, 4, 7, 10], k = 2
Output: [1, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10]

```


## Intuition


In a k-sorted array, each element is at most k indexes away from where it would be in a fully sorted array. We can visualize this with the following example where k = 2, and no number is more than k indexes away from its sorted position:


![Image represents a visual depiction of sorting a k-sorted array where k=2.  The top row shows the unsorted input array `[5, 1, 9, 4, 7, 10]` with indices 0 through 5 displayed below each element.  The bottom row displays the sorted array `[1, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10]` with corresponding indices.  Curved arrows connect elements from the unsorted array to their final positions in the sorted array.  The arrows illustrate the movement of elements during the sorting process.  Specifically, element 5 at index 0 moves to index 2, element 1 at index 1 moves to index 0, element 9 at index 2 moves to index 4, element 4 at index 3 moves to index 1, element 7 at index 4 moves to index 3, and element 10 at index 5 remains at index 5. The gray arrows indicate that the elements are not necessarily directly adjacent in the sorted array, reflecting the k-sorted property (elements are at most k positions away from their sorted position).  The text 'k-sorted array:' and 'sorted:' labels the input and output arrays respectively.  The value `k = 2` indicates that each element is at most 2 positions away from its correct sorted position in the input array.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/heaps/sort-a-k-sorted-array/image-08-04-1-LMP2WLBK.svg)

A trivial solution to this problem is to sort the array using a standard sorting algorithm. However, since the input is partially sorted (k-sorted), we should assume there's a faster way to sort the array.


We can think about this problem backward. For any index `i`, **the element that belongs at index `i` in the sorted array is located within the range [`i` - `k`, `i` + `k`]**. Below, we visualize how number 7, which is meant to be at index 3 when sorted, correctly falls within the range [3 - `k`, 3 + `k`] in the k-sorted array:


![Image represents a visual explanation of a sorting algorithm, likely illustrating a concept related to k-sorted arrays.  The diagram shows a k-sorted array `[5, 1, 9, 4, 7, 10]` represented as a trapezoid with a light-blue fill.  A horizontal cyan line segment spans the top of the trapezoid, labeled `3 - k` on the left and `3 + k` on the right, indicating a window of size 2k+1 centered around the element at index 3 (assuming 0-based indexing). The number 7 is circled within this window, highlighting its position.  The trapezoid's bottom edge connects to a fully sorted array `[1, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10]` below, demonstrating the result of a sorting operation. The number 3 is placed below the sorted array, possibly indicating the index of the middle element in the sorted array or the length of the sorted subarray. The overall structure visually demonstrates how a portion of a k-sorted array (the window) is sorted to obtain a fully sorted array.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/heaps/sort-a-k-sorted-array/image-08-04-2-KL6SW5XD.svg)

This is a good start, but we can reduce this range even further. Consider index 0 from the above array. We know the number which belongs at index 0 when sorted is somewhere in the range [0, 0 + `k`]:


![Image represents a visual explanation of sorting a k-sorted array.  The top row shows a 'k-sorted array' [5, 1, 9, 4, 7, 10], labeled as such.  A light-blue trapezoid highlights a section of this array, specifically the elements [5, 1, 9].  A horizontal, light-blue arrow above this section points from index \u03B8 (zero) to index \u03B8 + k, indicating a window of size k elements. The number '1' within the highlighted section is circled, emphasizing its position. The bottom row displays the 'sorted' array [1, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10], resulting from sorting the k-sorted array.  A vertical light-blue line connects the beginning of both arrays (index \u03B8), and a diagonal line connects the end of the highlighted section in the k-sorted array to the end of the corresponding sorted section in the sorted array, visually demonstrating the transformation.

Note that the sorted array in the diagrams is purely provided as a reference point. We don't yet know which number in the range [0, 0 + `k`] belongs at index 0. However, one fact remains consistent: in a sorted array, index 0 always holds the smallest number. This means the value needed at index 0 is also the smallest number within the range [0, 0 + `k`] of the k-sorted array, which is 1 in this example.


So, let's swap 1 with the number at index 0 to position 1 as the first value in the sorted array:


![Image represents a step-by-step illustration of a sorting algorithm applied to a k-sorted array.  The top line shows an initial k-sorted array `[5 1 9 4 7 10]`, where a light-blue highlighted sub-array `[5 1 9]` represents a window of size `k` starting at index `0`. A light-blue line extends from index `0` to `0 + k`, indicating the window's boundaries.  An arrow points down from a small box containing 'i', suggesting this is the 'i'th iteration of the algorithm. Below, a second line displays the array after a swap operation: `[1 5 9 4 7 10]`.  The word 'swapped' and curved arrows indicate that elements 1 and 5 have been swapped. To the right, a dashed box describes the operation performed: 'swap nums[i] with min([5 1 9])', highlighting that the element at index `i` (5) was swapped with the minimum element (1) within the k-sized window. The number 1 is highlighted in peach within the `min()` function to emphasize its selection as the minimum value.  The diagram visually demonstrates a single iteration of a sorting algorithm that iteratively swaps elements within a k-sized window to achieve a sorted array.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/heaps/sort-a-k-sorted-array/image-08-04-4-X37R6NX6.svg)

Now let's find the number that belongs at index 1: the second smallest number. Since index 0 currently contains the smallest value in the array, we won't need to consider index 0 in our search. Therefore, we can find the value that belongs at index 1 in the range [1, 1 + k]. The smallest value in this range will be the second smallest value overall, which is 4 in this case.


So, let's swap 4 with the number at index 1 to position 4 as the second value in the sorted array:

An arrow points down from a box labeled 'i', indicating the index being processed. A dashed box to the right explains the operation: 'swap nums[i] with min([5 9 4])', highlighting '4' as the minimum value within the highlighted sub-array.

If we continue this process for the rest of the array, we'll successfully sort the k-sorted array.


The main inefficiency with this approach is finding the minimum number in the range [`i`, `i + k`] at each index `i`. Linearly searching for it will take O(k)O(k)O(k) time at each index.


To improve this approach, we'd need a way to efficiently access the minimum value at each of these ranges. A **min-heap** would be perfect for this.


**Min-heap**

For a min-heap to determine the minimum value within each range [`i`, `i + k`], it will always need to be populated with the values in these ranges as we iterate through the array. Let's see how this works over the same example.


---


Before we can determine which value belongs at index 0, we'll need to populate the heap with all the values in the range [0, `k`], which are the first `k + 1` values (where `k = 2` in this example):

An alternative way to create a heap of the first `k + 1` elements is to heapify a list of the first `k + 1` elements.

Now, let's begin inserting the smallest elements from the heap into the array, using the `insert_index` pointer. The value that belongs at index 0 in sorted order is the value currently at the top of the heap, which is 1:

The min-heap now contains 4, 5, and 9, with `min: 4` indicating the current minimum.  Dashed arrows indicate the movement of `insert_index` and `i` through the array.  The overall diagram visualizes the iterative process of constructing a min-heap by sequentially adding elements from an array.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/heaps/sort-a-k-sorted-array/image-08-04-11-VM2M3JGH.svg)

Let's continue this process for the remaining numbers:


![Image represents a step-by-step illustration of a sorting algorithm, likely using a min-heap data structure.  The top half shows an initial state: an array `nums` containing `[1, 1, 9, 4, 7, 10]` is indexed by `insert_index` (initially pointing to the first element, highlighted in green) and `i` (pointing to the second element). A min-heap, labeled `min_heap`, contains the values `5` and `9`.  An arrow indicates that the minimum value from the min-heap (4, highlighted in purple) is assigned to `nums[insert_index]`, replacing the initial value. The bottom half depicts the next step:  `insert_index` has advanced to the next position. The value at `nums[i]` (4) is pushed onto the `min_heap`, updating it to contain `5` and `9`.  A separate box describes the actions performed:  popping the minimum element from the min-heap and assigning it to the array element at `insert_index`, then pushing the next array element onto the min-heap, incrementing both `insert_index` and `i`.

Once the heap is empty, the array is sorted.


## Implementation


```python
from typing import List
import heapq
        
def sort_a_k_sorted_array(nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
    # Populate a min-heap with the first k + 1 values in 'nums'.
    min_heap = nums[:k+1]
    heapq.heapify(min_heap)
    # Replace elements in the array with the minimum from the heap at each
    # iteration.
    insert_index = 0
    for i in range(k + 1, len(nums)):
        nums[insert_index] = heapq.heappop(min_heap)
        insert_index += 1
        heapq.heappush(min_heap, nums[i])
    # Pop the remaining elements from the heap to finish sorting the array.
    while min_heap:
        nums[insert_index] = heapq.heappop(min_heap)
        insert_index += 1
    return nums

```


```javascript
import { MinPriorityQueue } from './helpers/heap/index.js'

export function sort_a_k_sorted_array(nums, k) {
  // Populate a min-heap with the first k + 1 values in 'nums'.
  const minHeap = new MinPriorityQueue((x) => x)
  for (let i = 0; i <= k && i < nums.length; i++) {
    minHeap.enqueue(nums[i])
  }
  // Replace elements in the array with the minimum from the heap at each iteration.
  let insertIndex = 0
  for (let i = k + 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
    nums[insertIndex] = minHeap.dequeue()
    insertIndex++
    minHeap.enqueue(nums[i])
  }
  // Pop the remaining elements from the heap to finish sorting the array.
  while (!minHeap.isEmpty()) {
    nums[insertIndex] = minHeap.dequeue()
    insertIndex++
  }
  return nums
}

```


```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.PriorityQueue;

class Main {
    public ArrayList<Integer> sort_a_k_sorted_array(ArrayList<Integer> nums, int k) {
        // Populate a min-heap with the first k + 1 values in 'nums'.
        PriorityQueue<Integer> minHeap = new PriorityQueue<>();
        int n = nums.size();
        for (int i = 0; i <= Math.min(k, n - 1); i++) {
            minHeap.offer(nums.get(i));
        }
        // Replace elements in the array with the minimum from the heap at each
        // iteration.
        int insertIndex = 0;
        for (int i = k + 1; i < n; i++) {
            nums.set(insertIndex++, minHeap.poll());
            minHeap.offer(nums.get(i));
        }
        // Pop the remaining elements from the heap to finish sorting the array.
        while (!minHeap.isEmpty()) {
            nums.set(insertIndex++, minHeap.poll());
        }
        return nums;
    }
}

```


### Complexity Analysis


**Time complexity:** The time complexity of `sort_a_k_sorted_array` is O(nlog⁡(k))O(n\log(k))O(nlog(k)), where nnn denotes the length of the array. Here's why:

- We perform heapify on a min_heap of size k+1k+1k+1 which takes O(k)O(k)O(k) time. Note that kkk is upper-bounded by nnn in this operation since the heap won't have more than nnn values.
- Then, we perform `push` and `pop` operations on approximately n−kn-kn−k values using the heap. Since the heap can grow up to a size of k+1k+1k+1, each `push` and `pop` operations takes O(log⁡(k))O(\log(k))O(log(k)) time. Therefore, this loop takes O(nlog⁡(k))O(n\log(k))O(nlog(k)) time in the worst case.
- The final while-loop runs in O(klog⁡(k))O(k\log(k))O(klog(k)) time since we pop k+1k+1k+1 values from the heap. Note that kkk here is also upper-bounded by nnn.

Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(k)+O(nlog⁡(k))+O(klog⁡(k))=O(nlog⁡(k))O(k)+O(n\log(k))+O(k\log(k))=O(n\log(k))O(k)+O(nlog(k))+O(klog(k))=O(nlog(k)).


**Space complexity:** The space complexity is O(k)O(k)O(k) since the heap can grow up to k+1k+1k+1 in size.
