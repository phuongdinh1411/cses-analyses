#### Constraints:

- The linked list contains at least one node.

## Intuition


We can divide this problem into two objectives:

- Find the position of the kth last node.
- Remove this node.

Let’s first understand how node removal works. Consider the example below, where we need to remove node b. To do this, we need access to the node preceding it (node a), so we can redirect the pointer of node a to skip over node b. This ensures node b is no longer reachable through linked list traversal:


![Image represents a linked list data structure illustrating the removal of a node.  A rectangular box labeled 'prev' points downwards with an arrow to a circular node labeled 'a'. Node 'a' connects via a rightward arrow to a highlighted, red-bordered circular node labeled 'b', which is further connected via a rightward arrow to a circular node labeled 'c'. A red curved arrow points from the text 'node to remove' (in red) to node 'b', indicating the node to be deleted.  To the right, a dashed-line rectangle contains the code snippet 'prev.next = prev.next.next', representing the algorithm to remove node 'b'. This code updates the 'next' pointer of the preceding node ('prev') to skip the node being removed ('b') and point directly to the following node ('c'), effectively removing 'b' from the list.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/linked-lists/remove-the-kth-last-node-from-a-linked-list/image-03-02-1-XPPCQQWL.svg)

This indicates **we need to find the node directly before the kth last node** in order to remove it.


A naive solution to this problem is to first obtain the length of the linked list (n) by traversing it. Then, use this length to determine the number of steps required to arrive at the node before the kth last node, which is just n - k - 1 steps. This solution involves two for-loops, but is there a cleaner way to approach this problem?


The challenge with navigating a singly linked list in a single for-loop is that as we traverse, it’s hard to tell how far we are from the final node. The only way we’d know this is when we reach the final node itself, since its next node is null. How can we make use of this information?


Consider using two pointers instead of one. Could we create a scenario where, by the time one pointer reaches the end of the linked list, another pointer is positioned before the kth last node? Let’s explore this logic using the following example:


![Image represents a directed graph illustrating a sequence of nodes connected by unidirectional arrows.  The nodes are represented by circles containing numerical values: 1, 2, 4, 7, and 3.  The node labeled '1' is designated as 'head'.  Arrows indicate the flow of information from one node to the next, starting from node 1 and proceeding sequentially to node 2, then node 4, then node 7, and finally node 3.  The graph is accompanied by the text ', k = 2', suggesting a parameter 'k' with a value of 2, likely relevant to the algorithm or process depicted by the graph's structure.  The overall structure suggests a linear progression or a simple linked list data structure, possibly demonstrating a specific coding pattern or algorithm step.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/linked-lists/remove-the-kth-last-node-from-a-linked-list/image-03-02-3-3QJ7PKK2.svg)

We denote the first pointer as leader and the pointer that follows it as trailer. When the leader pointer reaches the last node of the linked list, we want the trailer pointer to end up at node 4 (the node right before the kth last node) to prepare for deletion. In other words, the leader should be k nodes in front of the trailer when the leader reaches the last node.

A light gray shaded node 7 is present.  A blue box labeled 'trailer' points down to node 4, and an orange box labeled 'leader' points down to node 3. A gray line segment underlines nodes 4 and 7, with 'k = 2' written below it, indicating the window size.

The window's position is dynamically updated as the leader advances through the list.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/linked-lists/remove-the-kth-last-node-from-a-linked-list/image-03-02-4-JSDDALXN.svg)

To achieve this, we can start by advancing the leader pointer through the linked list for k steps. When the leader pointer is k nodes ahead of the trailer, we can advance both pointers together until the leader reaches the last node. This process will be explained in more detail soon.


However, there’s an important edge case to consider first: **what if the head itself is the node we need to remove?** In this case, there’s no node before the head, so we cannot perform the removal, as mentioned earlier. To circumvent this, we can create a `dummy` node, place it before the head node, and start our traversal from there.

Let’s now try incorporating our strategy into the example.

After this removal, we just return `dummy.next`, which points at the head of the modified linked list.


## Implementation

from ds import ListNode
    
def remove_kth_last_node(head: ListNode, k: int) -> ListNode:
    # A dummy node to ensure there's a node before 'head' in case we need to remove
    # the head node.
    dummy = ListNode(-1)
    dummy.next = head
    trailer = leader = dummy
    # Advance 'leader' k steps ahead.
    for _ in range(k):
        leader = leader.next
        # If k is larger than the length of the linked list, no node needs to be
        # removed.
        if not leader:
            return head
    # Move 'leader' to the end of the linked list, keeping 'trailer' k nodes behind.
    while leader.next:
        leader = leader.next
        trailer = trailer.next
    # Remove the kth node from the end.
    trailer.next = trailer.next.next
    return dummy.next

```

  const dummy = new ListNode(-1)
  dummy.next = head
  let trailer = dummy
  let leader = dummy
  // Advance 'leader' k steps ahead.
  for (let i = 0; i < k; i++) {
    leader = leader.next
    // If k is larger than the length of the linked list, no node needs to be

  }

  return dummy.next
}

### Complexity Analysis


**Time complexity:** The time complexity of `remove_kth_last_node` is O(n)O(n)O(n). This is because the algorithm first traverses at most nnn nodes of the linked list, and then two pointers traverse the linked list at most once each.


**Space complexity:** The space complexity is O(1)O(1)O(1).
