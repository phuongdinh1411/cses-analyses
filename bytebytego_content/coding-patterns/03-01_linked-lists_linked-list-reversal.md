# Linked List Reversal

![Image represents two directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) arranged vertically.  The top DAG consists of five nodes labeled 1, 2, 4, 7, and 3, connected sequentially by directed edges (arrows) in that order.  The bottom DAG also has five nodes, labeled 3, 7, 4, 2, and 1, connected sequentially by directed edges in that order. A thick, downward-pointing arrow connects the node labeled '4' in the top DAG to the node labeled '4' in the bottom DAG, indicating a transition or transformation between the two graphs.  The overall structure suggests a before-and-after representation, possibly illustrating a process or algorithm that rearranges the sequence of nodes.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/linked-lists/linked-list-reversal/linked-list-reversal-TFWR7ODD.svg)

## Intuition - Iterative


A naive strategy is to store the values of the linked list in an array and reconstruct the linked list by traversing the array in reverse order. However, this solution does not reverse the original linked list; it just creates a new one. Could we try performing the reversal in place?


Let’s think about the problem in terms of pointer manipulation. The key observation here is that if we "flip" the direction of the pointers, we're effectively reversing the linked list:


![Image represents a visual illustration of a sequence reversal. The top row, labeled 'original:', shows a directed acyclic graph (DAG) with nodes numbered 1, 2, 4, 7, and 3, connected by black arrows indicating a unidirectional flow from 1 to 2, 2 to 4, 4 to 7, and 7 to 3.  The second row, labeled 'reversed:', displays the same nodes but with orange arrows reversing the direction of flow, pointing from 3 to 7, 7 to 4, 4 to 2, and 2 to 1. The third row shows an equals sign followed by a sequence of nodes (3, 7, 4, 2, 1) connected by orange arrows, representing the reversed sequence in a forward direction, effectively demonstrating the reversed order of the original sequence.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/linked-lists/linked-list-reversal/image-03-01-1-3IRSAE57.svg)

Now, we just need to figure out how to perform this pointer manipulation. Consider the example below:


![Image represents a simple directed acyclic graph (DAG) illustrating a sequential process or workflow.  The graph consists of three circular nodes, labeled '1,' '2,' and '3,' respectively, arranged linearly from left to right.  Each node likely represents a stage or step in a process.  Thick, unidirectional arrows connect the nodes, indicating the flow of information or execution.  Specifically, an arrow points from node '1' to node '2,' signifying that stage '2' follows stage '1,' and another arrow points from node '2' to node '3,' indicating that stage '3' follows stage '2.'  The overall structure depicts a linear progression where the output of one stage becomes the input for the subsequent stage.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/linked-lists/linked-list-reversal/image-03-01-2-CHIYGAUJ.svg)

To reverse the direction of all pointers, we iterate through the nodes one by one. In this process, we need access to the current node (`curr_node`) and the previous node (`prev_node`) to adjust the current node's next pointer to the previous node. Note that `prev_node` will initially point at null since the first node has no previous node:


![Image represents a diagram illustrating a coding pattern, possibly related to linked lists or similar data structures.  Two rectangular boxes labeled 'prev_node' (in orange) and 'curr_node' (also in orange) are positioned above a sequence of three circles representing nodes numbered 1, 2, and 3.  Arrows descend from 'prev_node' and 'curr_node' pointing to 'null' and node 1 respectively.  Nodes 1, 2, and 3 are connected by unidirectional arrows indicating the next node in the sequence.  To the right, a dashed-line rectangle contains the code snippet 'curr_node.next = prev_node', suggesting an operation to modify the linked list structure by changing the 'next' pointer of the current node to point to the previous node.

To reverse the next pointer, we'll need a way to shift the `curr_node` and `prev_node` pointers one node over. To shift `prev_node`, we can set it to the position of `curr_node`. However, we can't move `curr_node` to node 2 because we lost our reference to node 2:


![Image represents a linked list data structure undergoing a deletion operation.  At the top, two orange rectangular boxes labeled `prev_node` and `curr_node` represent pointers.  A dashed orange line connects them, indicating a relationship between these pointers. A red 'X' is positioned to the right of `curr_node`, signifying the node to be deleted. Below, a linked list is depicted with three circular nodes containing the numbers 1, 2, and 3, respectively.  A solid black arrow points from node 1 to `null`, indicating the beginning of the list.  Another solid black arrow connects node 2 to node 3.  A red curved arrow points from node 1 to node 2, labeled 'no reference to node 2,' illustrating that after the deletion, node 1 no longer points to node 2, effectively removing node 2 from the list.

This suggests we should have preserved a reference to node 2 **before** reversing the `curr_node`. This can be done by creating a variable `next_node` and setting it to `curr_node.next`. Let’s assume we did this. Now, we can advance `prev_node` and `curr_node` forward by one:

A dashed-line rectangle to the right displays assignment statements: 'prev_node = curr_node' and 'curr_node = next_node', representing the iterative process of traversing the linked list, where the previous node becomes the current node, and the current node becomes the next node in each step.

Note, we don't need to shift `next_node`, as it can be set by `curr_node.next` in the next iteration.


We can summarize this logic in three steps. At each node in the linked list:

- Save a reference to the next node (`next_node = curr_node.next`).
- Change the current node’s next pointer to link to the previous node (`curr_node.next = prev_node`).
- Move both `prev_node` and `curr_node` forward by one (`prev_node = curr_node`,`curr_node = next_node`).

We can stop the reversal when `curr_node` becomes null, indicating there are no more nodes to reverse.


The final step is to return the head of the reversed linked list, which is pointed to by `prev_node` once `curr_node` becomes null.


## Implementation - Iterative


```python
from ds import ListNode
   
def linked_list_reversal(head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
    curr_node, prev_node = head, None
    # Reverse the direction of each node's pointer until 'curr_node' is null.
    while curr_node:
        next_node = curr_node.next
        curr_node.next = prev_node
        prev_node = curr_node
curr_node = next_node # 'prev_node' will be pointing at the head of the reversed linked list.
return prev_node

```


```javascript
import { ListNode } from './ds.js'

export function linked_list_reversal(head) {
  let currNode = head
  let prevNode = null
  // Reverse the direction of each node's pointer until 'currNode' is null.
  while (currNode) {
    const nextNode = currNode.next
    currNode.next = prevNode
    prevNode = currNode
    currNode = nextNode
  }
  // 'prevNode' will be pointing at the head of the reversed linked list.
  return prevNode
}

```


```java
import core.LinkedList.ListNode;

public class Main {
    public static ListNode<Integer> linked_list_reversal(ListNode<Integer> head) {
        ListNode<Integer> currNode = head;
        ListNode<Integer> prevNode = null;
        // Reverse the direction of each node's pointer until 'currNode' is null.
        while (currNode != null) {
            ListNode<Integer> nextNode = currNode.next;
            currNode.next = prevNode;
            prevNode = currNode;
            currNode = nextNode;
        }
        // 'prevNode' will be pointing at the head of the reversed linked list.
        return prevNode;
    }
}

```


### Complexity Analysis


**Time complexity:** The time complexity of `linked_list_reversal` is O(n)O(n)O(n), where nnn denotes the length of the linked list. This is because we perform constant-time pointer manipulation at each node of the linked list.


**Space complexity:** The space complexity is O(1)O(1)O(1).


## Intuition - Recursive


Sometimes, the interviewer may want the problem solved using recursion. Let’s see what a recursive solution to this problem would look like.


In a recursive solution, the problem is solved by **solving smaller instances of the same problem**. To solve these smaller subproblems, we would need to use the linked list reversal function (`linked_list_reversal`) in its own implementation. The process of solving smaller problems using recursive calls continues until the smallest version of the problem is solved.


The smallest version of this problem involves reversing a linked list of size 0 or 1. These are linked lists which are inherently the same as their reverse. So, these can be our **base cases**.


With this in mind, let's try crafting the logic of the recursive function using the example below:


![Image represents a linked list data structure.  A rectangular box labeled 'head' points downwards to a circle containing the number '1,' representing the first node in the list.  This node is connected by a unidirectional arrow to a circle containing '2,' which is similarly connected to a circle containing '3,' and finally '3' is connected to a circle containing '4,' the last node.  The arrows indicate the direction of traversal through the list, starting from the head node and progressing sequentially through each node to the end.  Each circle represents a node in the list, and the numbers within the circles could represent data stored within each node.  The structure visually demonstrates the linear, sequential nature of a singly linked list.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/linked-lists/linked-list-reversal/image-03-01-16-PEACUQHN.svg)

Think about which subproblem we should solve. To reverse the entire linked list, we can use our `linked_list_reversal` function to **reverse the sublist after the current node**. This way, we only need to focus on reversing the pointer of the current node. Let’s see how this works.


As mentioned, let’s first recursively call `linked_list_reversal` on the sublist starting at `head.next`. Let’s assume this recursive call reverses this sublist and returns its head as intended.


> When designing a recursive function, assume any recursive call to that function will behave as intended, even if the function hasn’t been fully implemented.


![Image represents a singly linked list data structure undergoing reversal.  A rectangular box encloses nodes numbered 2, 3, and 4, representing the linked list's initial state.  Arrows indicate the direction of links between these nodes, starting from node 2 and proceeding sequentially to node 4.  A separate node, labeled '1', is positioned to the left of the box, connected to node 2 via an arrow, indicating it's the head of the list.  Above node 1, a rectangular box labeled 'head' points downwards with an arrow towards node 1, showing the initial head pointer. Below the rectangular box containing nodes 2, 3, and 4, a dashed-line box contains the code snippet `new_head = linked_list_reversal(head.next)`. This line suggests that a function called `linked_list_reversal` is being called with the `next` pointer of the initial `head` (node 1) as an argument, and the result is assigned to `new_head`, implying the reversal operation is performed on the sublist starting from node 2.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/linked-lists/linked-list-reversal/image-03-01-17-SD7RNZUB.svg)

Next, we need the tail of the reversed sublist (node 2) to point to node 1. We can reference node 2 using `head.next`. So, all we need to do is set `head.next.next` to head as illustrated below:


![Image represents a linked list data structure before and after inserting a new node.  Initially, a linked list is shown with nodes numbered 1, 2, and 3, where a rectangular box labeled 'head' points to node 1, indicating the beginning of the list.  Each node is a circle containing its numerical value, and arrows represent the `next` pointers connecting them sequentially. A new node, labeled '4', is introduced with a rectangular box labeled 'new_head' pointing to it.  An arrow connects 'new_head' to node 4.  Node 4 is then linked to node 3, reversing the previous order. A dashed rectangular box displays the code snippet 'head.next.next = head', illustrating the operation performed to insert node 4 at the head of the list by updating the `next` pointer of the second node (originally pointing to node 3) to now point to the original head (node 1).  This effectively inserts node 4 as the new head of the linked list.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/linked-lists/linked-list-reversal/image-03-01-19-DM7SPWQ7.svg)

The linked list is almost fully reversed now, but node 1 is still pointing to node 2. To remove this link, just set `head.next` to null. Then, we can return `new_head`, which is the head of the reversed linked list:

export function linked_list_reversal_recursive(head) {

  if (!head || !head.next) {
    return head;
  }
  // Recursively reverse the sublist starting at the next node.
  const newHead = linked_list_reversal_recursive(head.next);
  // Connect the reversed sublist to the head node to fully reverse the entire linked list.
  head.next.next = head;
  head.next = null;
  return newHead;
}

```


### Complexity Analysis


**Time complexity:** The time complexity of `linked_list_reversal_recursive` is O(n)O(n)O(n) because it involves a single recursive traversal through the linked list, visiting each node exactly once.


**Space complexity:** The space complexity is O(n)O(n)O(n) due to the stack space taken up by the recursive call stack, which grows up to nnn levels deep because nnn recursive calls are made.


## Interview Tip


*Tip: Visualize pointer manipulations.*

Often, it can be tricky to figure out exactly what to do when dealing with linked list manipulation. Drawing pointers as arrows between nodes can be quite helpful. By observing how these arrows should be reoriented to represent changes in the linked list's structure, we can deduce the necessary pointer manipulation logic. This approach also helps identify which nodes we need references to when making these changes.
