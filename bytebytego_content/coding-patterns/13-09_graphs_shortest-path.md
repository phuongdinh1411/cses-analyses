# Shortest Path

![Image represents a weighted directed graph, possibly illustrating a shortest path problem or a similar graph traversal algorithm.  The graph consists of six nodes, numbered 0 through 5. Node 0, labeled 'start' in orange, is the designated starting node and is highlighted with an orange border.  The remaining nodes (1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) are represented as simple circles containing their respective numerical labels.  Edges connect the nodes, with each edge labeled with a numerical weight representing the cost or distance between the connected nodes.  Specifically, node 0 connects to node 1 (weight 5) and node 2 (weight 3). Node 1 connects to node 2 (weight 1) and node 3 (weight 4). Node 2 connects to node 4 (weight 5) and node 3 (weight 4). Node 3 connects to node 1 (weight 4). Node 5 is an isolated node, not connected to any other node in the graph.  The arrangement suggests a flow of information or traversal from the starting node (0) towards the other nodes, with the edge weights influencing the path selection in an algorithm.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/graphs/shortest-path/shortest-path-LFJ3BTT2.svg)


Given an integer `n` representing nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1` in an undirected graph, and an array of non-negative weighted edges, return an array where each index `i` contains the **shortest path length** from a specified start node to node `i`. If a node is unreachable, set its distance to -1.


Each edge is represented by a triplet of positive integers: the start node, the end node, and the weight of the edge.

## Intuition


There are a few algorithms that can be employed to find the shortest path in a graph. Let’s consider some of our options:

- BFS works well for finding the shortest path when the graph has edges with no weight, or uniform weight across the edges, as BFS doesn’t take weight into account in its traversal strategy.
- Dijkstra’s algorithm works well for graphs with non-negative weights, as it efficiently finds the shortest path from a single source to all other nodes.
- The Bellman-Ford algorithm works well for graphs with edges that may have negative weights [[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellman%E2%80%93Ford_algorithm).
- The Floyd-Warshall algorithm works well when we need to find the shortest paths between all pairs of nodes in a graph [[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd%E2%80%93Warshall_algorithm).

Among these options, **Dijkstra’s algorithm** suits this problem the most since we’re dealing with a graph with non-negative weighted edges, and we need to find the shortest path from a start node to all other nodes. This algorithm uses a greedy strategy, which we’ll explore during this explanation.


Consider the undirected weighted graph below, with node 0 as the starting node.


![Image represents a weighted graph, a network of nodes (circles) connected by edges (lines).  The nodes are labeled with numbers 0 through 5. Node 0 is connected to node 1 with an edge labeled '5' and to node 2 with an edge labeled '3'. Node 1 is connected to node 2 with an edge labeled '1' and to node 3 with an edge labeled '4'. Node 2 is connected to node 3 with an edge labeled '4' and to node 4 with an edge labeled '5'. Node 3 is connected to node 4 with an edge labeled '4'. Node 5 is an isolated node, not connected to any other node in the graph.  The numbers on the edges represent weights or costs associated with traversing that connection.  The arrangement shows a somewhat clustered structure with nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 forming a connected subgraph, while node 5 remains isolated.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/graphs/shortest-path/image-13-09-1-ATVNYFYF.svg)

Initially, since we don't know any of the distances between node 0 and the other nodes, we'll set them to infinity. The only distance we do know is from the start node to itself, which is just 0:


![Image represents a weighted, undirected graph with six nodes (labeled 0 through 5) and several edges connecting them.  The edges are labeled with their corresponding weights. Node 0 connects to node 1 (weight 5) and node 2 (weight 3). Node 1 connects to node 2 (weight 1), node 3 (weight 4), and node 0 (weight 5). Node 2 connects to node 4 (weight 5) and node 3 (weight 4). Node 3 connects to node 1 (weight 4). Node 4 and node 5 are isolated nodes, not connected to any other nodes in the graph. To the right of the graph, a list named 'distances' is shown, initialized as `[0, \u221E, \u221E, \u221E, \u221E, \u221E]`.  The numbers below the list (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) correspond to the indices of the nodes in the graph, indicating that the list represents the distances from a starting node (likely node 0, given the initial 0 in the list) to each of the other nodes in the graph.  The symbol \u221E represents infinity, signifying that initially, the distances to nodes other than the starting node are considered unreachable.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/graphs/shortest-path/image-13-09-2-OFCKPTIT.svg)

Let’s begin with the start node. Consider its immediate neighbors, nodes 1 and 2. The distances from node 0 to these nodes are 5 and 3, respectively. We don't know if these are the shortest distances from 0 to them, but they’re definitely shorter than infinity. So, let's update the distances to those nodes from node 0:


![Image represents a weighted graph illustrating a shortest path algorithm, possibly Dijkstra's algorithm.  The graph consists of six nodes (0-5), with node 0 labeled 'curr' and colored orange, indicating a starting node.  Nodes 1 and 2 are light blue, suggesting they've been visited.  The remaining nodes (3, 4, 5) are unvisited.  Edges connecting the nodes are labeled with their respective weights (1, 3, 4, 5). For instance, node 0 connects to node 1 with a weight of 5 and to node 2 with a weight of 3. Node 1 connects to node 2 with a weight of 1 and to node 3 with a weight of 4. Node 2 connects to node 4 with a weight of 5. Node 3 connects to node 1 with a weight of 4.  To the right, a distances array `[\u221E \u221E \u221E \u221E \u221E \u221E]` is shown, representing the initial distances from the source node (0) to all other nodes, where \u221E denotes infinity.  The array is partially updated, showing distances 5 and 3, calculated from the source node to nodes 1 and 2 respectively, indicated by light blue lines connecting the array to the corresponding nodes in the graph.  The array's index corresponds to the node number.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/graphs/shortest-path/image-13-09-3-BJRLJEOE.svg)

Right now, the closest node to the start node is node 2, with a distance of 3. This confirms that the shortest distance to node 2 from node 0 is 3, as the alternative route through node 1 has a longer distance. Thus, we can be certain that node 2 is reached through the shortest possible path, so let’s move to it:


![Image represents a graph illustrating a shortest path algorithm, possibly Dijkstra's algorithm.  The left side shows a weighted, undirected graph with five nodes (numbered 0-4). Node 0 is greyed out, suggesting it's the starting node.  Edges connecting the nodes are labeled with their weights (e.g., the edge between nodes 1 and 2 has a weight of 1). Node 2 is highlighted in orange and labeled 'curr,' indicating it's the currently processed node. The right side displays a distances array `distances = [\u221E, 5, 3, \u221E, \u221E, \u221E]`, representing the shortest distances from the starting node (0) to each node.

An upward-pointing arrow next to the array points to this value, explicitly labeling it as the 'shortest distance from start'.  The infinity symbols (\u221E) represent initially unknown distances, which are updated during the algorithm's execution.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/graphs/shortest-path/image-13-09-4-66LY6CQD.svg)

The current node is now node 2. Keep in mind that, so far, we’ve traversed a distance of `distance[2] = 3` from node 0 to reach node 2.


The immediate unvisited neighbors of the current node are nodes 1, 3, and 4. The distances to them from the start node are 1 + 3, 4 + 3, and 5 + 3 (where the +3 accounts for the distance traveled so far). Let’s update the distance array with these distances since they are smaller than the distances currently set for them:


![Image represents a weighted graph illustrating a shortest path algorithm, possibly Dijkstra's algorithm.  The graph consists of five nodes (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5), represented by circles. Node 2 is highlighted in orange and labeled 'curr,' indicating the current node being processed.  Edges connect nodes, with weights (distances) shown on the edges. For example, node 1 connects to node 2 with a weight of 1, and node 2 connects to node 4 with a weight of 5. Node 0 is connected to node 2 with a weight of 3.  A light blue edge indicates a path being considered.  To the right, a 'distances' array is shown, initialized with infinity (\u221E) for all nodes except the starting node (0), which is 0.

Right now, among the unvisited nodes, the node with the shortest distance from the start node is node 1, with a distance of 4. This means the shortest distance to node 1 from the start node is 4, since all other paths to node 1 involve traversing through distances larger than 4. So, let’s move to node 4:

The greedy choice made is now becoming clearer:


> At each step, we move to the unvisited node with the shortest known distance from the start node.


---


Applying this greedy choice for the rest of the graph completes Dijkstra’s algorithm, giving us an array populated with the shortest path lengths from the start node to each node:


![Image represents a weighted graph displayed alongside a distance array. The graph consists of six nodes, numbered 0 through 5, connected by weighted edges.

To implement the above strategy, we’d like an efficient way to access the unvisited node with the shortest known distance at any point in the process. We can use a **min-heap** for this, allowing us logarithmic access to the node with the minimum distance.


**Using the min-heap**

To understand how we use the min-heap in Dijkstra’s algorithm, consider the following example with the start node, node 0, initially in the min-heap with its corresponding distance of 0:


![Image represents a visualization of Dijkstra's algorithm's initial state.  On the left, a weighted directed graph is shown with three nodes labeled 0, 1, and 2. Node 0 is marked as 'start'.  Edges connect node 0 to node 1 with weight 6, and node 0 to node 2 with weight 3. Node 1 connects to node 2 with weight 1. Below the graph, a distances array is shown, initialized as [0, \u221E, \u221E], representing the initial distances from the start node (0) to each node (0, 1, and 2 respectively, where \u221E signifies infinity). On the right, a min-heap data structure is depicted, currently containing only node 0 with a value of 0, indicated by 'min: 0:0'.  The min-heap is used to efficiently select the node with the smallest distance from the start node during the algorithm's execution.  The overall image illustrates the setup before the algorithm begins iterating and updating distances.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/graphs/shortest-path/image-13-09-9-JH6WSPR3.svg)

Begin by popping the start node from the top of the heap and setting it to the current node. Then, add the current node’s neighbors to the min-heap with their corresponding distances from the start node, and update the distances of these neighbors:


![Image represents a step-by-step illustration of Dijkstra's algorithm using a min-heap.  The left side shows the initial state: a graph with three nodes (0, 1, 2), where node 0 (labeled 'curr' and colored orange) is the current node with a distance of 0.  Edges are weighted (6, 1, 3).  A min-heap is shown alongside, containing the initial distances: node 0 at distance 0, and nodes 1 and 2 at infinity (\u221E).  An arrow indicates that node 0 (with distance 0) is extracted from the min-heap, updating `curr_dist` to 0 and `curr_node` to 0. The right side depicts the state after updating the distances of node 0's neighbors. Node 1 and 2 are now colored cyan, reflecting their updated status. The distances to nodes 1 and 2 are updated to 6 and 3 respectively, reflected in the updated min-heap (6:1 and 3:2) and the `distances` array [0, 6, 3].  The arrow between the left and right sides signifies the transition between these states.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/graphs/shortest-path/image-13-09-10-UEDRYRWS.svg)

A min-heap is shown alongside, containing the initial distances: node 0 at distance 0, and nodes 1 and 2 at infinity (\u221E).  An arrow indicates that node 0 (with distance 0) is extracted from the min-heap, updating `curr_dist` to 0 and `curr_node` to 0. The right side depicts the state after updating the distances of node 0's neighbors. Node 1 and 2 are now colored cyan, reflecting their updated status. The distances to nodes 1 and 2 are updated to 6 and 3 respectively, reflected in the updated min-heap (6:1 and 3:2) and the `distances` array [0, 6, 3].  The arrow between the left and right sides signifies the transition between these states.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/graphs/shortest-path/image-13-09-10-UEDRYRWS.svg)

As we can see, we encounter an issue: **we’re revisiting node 1**. The only difference is that this time, we’re visiting it at a larger distance (`curr_dist = 6`) from the start than the recorded distance (4). We can avoid this situation with the following if-statement:


> `if curr_dist > distances[curr_node]: continue`


This check allows us to avoid using an additional data structure to keep track of visited nodes.

**Why does the greedy approach work?**

Before reading this section, it’s worth reviewing the *Greedy* chapter if you aren’t familiar with greedy algorithms.


Dijkstra's algorithm is considered greedy because, at each step, it selects the unvisited node with the shortest known distance from the start node, based on the assumption that this distance is the shortest possible path to that node. This choice is made as a local optimum, with the belief that it will lead to the global optima: the shortest path to all nodes. Can we always guarantee that this assumption is true? Consider the following graph, where the current node is node 0:


![Image represents a weighted graph illustrating a shortest path algorithm.  The graph consists of five nodes, numbered 0 through 4. Node 0, highlighted in orange and labeled 'curr,' represents the current node being processed. Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 are connected to node 0 with weighted edges; the weight of each edge is indicated by a number next to the connecting line (10, 3, 6, and 7 respectively). Dashed lines connect nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 to points above them, suggesting further connections not explicitly shown.  To the right, a list labeled 'dist' shows a partial array, likely representing the shortest distances from node 0 to other nodes in the graph. The array starts with 0 (the distance from 0 to itself), followed by 10, 3, 6, and 7, corresponding to the weights of the edges connecting node 0 to nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.  The ellipsis (...) indicates that the array continues beyond the displayed elements.  The numbers below the 'dist' array (0, 1, 2, 3, 4) likely represent the indices of the distances within the array, corresponding to the node numbers.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/graphs/shortest-path/image-13-09-14-HYLV5FLS.svg)

The node with the shortest known distance from the start node is node 2, with a distance of 3. We assume this is the shortest distance to node 2, and choose node 2 as the local optimum. Here’s a question we could ask here regarding the validity of this choice: is it possible to find a path with a distance less than 3 to another neighboring node, making node 2 no longer the neighbor with the shortest distance from the start node?


The answer is no. This is because we have to pass through one of these neighboring nodes to find any other paths, which would require us to add a distance of at least 3 to our total distance traversed from the start node. To reduce this traversed distance, we would need to encounter negatively weighted edges in the graph, which we know isn’t possible in this graph.


This analysis also demonstrates that **Dijkstra’s algorithm is only applicable when the graph has no edges with negative weights**.

    distances[start] = 0
    # Represent the graph as an adjacency list.
    for u, v, w in edges:
        graph[u].append((v, w))
        graph[v].append((u, w))
    min_heap = [(0, start)]  # (distance, node)
    # Use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between the start node
    # and all other nodes.
    while min_heap:
        curr_dist, curr_node = heapq.heappop(min_heap)
        # If the current distance to this node is greater than the recorded
        # distance, we've already found the shortest distance to this node.
        if curr_dist > distances[curr_node]:
            continue
        # Update the distances of the neighboring nodes.
        for neighbor, weight in graph[curr_node]:
            neighbor_dist = curr_dist + weight
            # Only update the distance if we find a shorter path to this
            # neighbor.
            if neighbor_dist < distances[neighbor]:
                distances[neighbor] = neighbor_dist
                heapq.heappush(min_heap, (neighbor_dist, neighbor))
    # Convert all infinity values to -1, representing unreachable nodes.
    return [-1 if dist == float('inf') else dist for dist in distances]

### Complexity Analysis


**Time complexity:** The time complexity of the `shortest_path` is O((n+e)log⁡(n))O((n+e)\log(n))O((n+e)log(n)), where eee represents the number of edges. Here’s why:

- Creating the adjacency list takes O(e)O(e)O(e) time.
- Dijkstra's algorithm traverses up to all nnn nodes and explores each edge of the graph. To access each node, we pop it from the heap, and for each edge, up to one node is pushed to the heap (when we process each node’s neighbors). Since each `push` and `pop` operation takes O(log⁡(n))O(\log(n))O(log(n)) time, the time complexity of Dijkstra’s algorithm is O((n+e)log⁡(n))O((n+e)\log(n))O((n+e)log(n)).

Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(e)+O((n+e)log⁡(n))=O((n+e)log⁡(n))O(e)+O((n+e)\log(n))=O((n+e)\log(n))O(e)+O((n+e)log(n))=O((n+e)log(n)).


**Space complexity:** The space complexity is O(n+e)O(n+e)O(n+e), since the adjacency list takes up O(n+e)O(n+e)O(n+e) space, whereas the `distances` array and `min_heap` take up O(n)O(n)O(n) space.
