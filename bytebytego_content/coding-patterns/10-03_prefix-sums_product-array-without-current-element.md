# Product Array Without Current Element

Given an array of integers, return an array res so that `res[i]` is equal to the product of all the elements of the input array except `nums[i]` itself.


#### Example:


```python
Input: nums = [2, 3, 1, 4, 5]
Output: [60, 40, 120, 30, 24]

```


Explanation: The output value at index 0 is the product of all numbers except `nums[0]` (3⋅1⋅4⋅5 = 60). The same logic applies to the rest of the output.


## Intuition


The straightforward solution to this problem is to find the total product of the array and divide it by each of the values in nums individually to get the output array:

The left side shows an array `[2, 3, 1, 4, 5]` with each element visually connected via orange curved lines to a central node labeled 'product = 120'. This indicates that the product of all elements in the array is 120. An arrow points to the right, leading to a calculation where 120 is divided by each element of the original array: `res = [120/2, 120/3, 120/1, 120/4, 120/5]`.  Below this, the results of these divisions are shown as a new array: `res = [60, 40, 120, 30, 24]`.

This approach allows us to solve the problem in linear time and constant space. However, a potential follow-up question by an interviewer is: **what if we can’t use division?** Let’s explore a solution to this.


**Avoiding division**

A brute force approach involves calculating the output value for each index one by one. This would take O(n)O(n)O(n) time per index, leading to an overall time complexity of O(n2)O(n^2)O(n2), where nnn denotes the length of the array. This is inefficient, so let's look at other approaches.


An important insight is that the output for any given index can be determined by multiplying two things:

- The product of all numbers to the left of the index.
- The product of all numbers to the right of the index.

Why is this helpful? If we have precomputed the products of all values to the left and right of each index, we can quickly calculate the output for each index. More specifically, we would need two arrays that contain the left and right products of each index, respectively:

- `left_products`*:* an array where `left_products[i]` is the **product of all values to the left of i**.
- `right_products`: an array where `right_products[i]` is the **product of all values to the right of i**.

To obtain the `left_products` array, we need to keep track of a cumulative product of all elements we encounter as we move from left to right. The value of this product at a specific index should represent the product of all values to its left. The same is true of the `right_products` array, but the cumulative products start from the right. Once we have these arrays, multiplying the left and right product values at each index gives us the output value of that index.


![Image represents a step-by-step calculation of the product of all elements in an array except the element at the current index.  The top row shows an input array `nums` containing the integers [2, 3, 1, 4, 5]. Below this, `left_products` array stores the cumulative product of elements to the left of each index in `nums`, starting with 1 (the product of zero elements).  Each element in `left_products` is calculated by multiplying the previous element by the corresponding element in `nums`. Similarly, `right_products` calculates the cumulative product of elements to the right of each index, starting from the rightmost element and moving left.  Asterisks (*) visually represent the multiplication operations between consecutive elements in `nums` to obtain `left_products`.  Double vertical lines (||) represent the multiplication between corresponding elements of `left_products` and `right_products` to produce the final `res` array, which contains the product of all elements in `nums` except the element at the current index.  For example, `res[0]` (60) is calculated as `left_products[0]` (1) * `right_products[0]` (60).](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/prefix-sums/product-array-without-current-element/image-10-03-3-VYSSWNKT.svg)

Since the left and right product arrays are formed through cumulative multiplication, this leads us to the concept of prefix products.


**Prefix products**

Prefix products are created in the same way as a prefix sum array, with two key differences:

- Instead of cumulative addition, we use cumulative multiplication.
- We initialize the prefix product array with 1 instead of 0, to avoid multiplying the cumulative products by 0.

Let’s try creating the `left_products` array, initializing it with 1 at index 0:


![Image represents a code snippet showcasing an array named `nums` initialized with the integer values [2, 3, 1, 4, 5].  Below it, another array named `left_products` is partially shown, initialized with the value `[1` suggesting it's an array intended to store the product of numbers to the left of each element in the `nums` array.  The arrangement is vertical, with `nums` above `left_products`, implying a sequential relationship where `left_products` is likely calculated based on the values in `nums`.  No explicit connections or information flow are visually depicted beyond the implied relationship between the two arrays; the image only shows the initial state of the arrays before any computation is performed.

For each subsequent index in the `left_products` array, we calculate its value by multiplying the running product by the previous value in the `nums` array:

The top row shows a list labeled 'nums = [2 3 1 4 5]', representing an array named 'nums' containing the integer values 2, 3, 1, 4, and 5.

Gray arrows point from the 'nums' array to the 'right_products' array, indicating a dependency.  A prominent orange curved arrow points from the first element of the 'right_products' array (60) to the asterisk (*) symbol, which is positioned between the two arrays, suggesting that the calculation starts from the rightmost element of the 'nums' array and proceeds leftward, accumulating products.

Once both arrays are populated, we can compute each value of the output array, where `res[i]` is equal to the product of `left_products[i]` and `right_products[i]`, as previously demonstrated.


**Reducing space**

We have successfully found a solution that doesn't involve division and runs in linear time. However, this solution takes up linear space due to the left and right product arrays. Can we compute the output array in place without taking up extra space?


An important thing to realize is that we don’t necessarily need to create the left and right product arrays to populate the output array. Instead, we can **directly compute and store the left and right products in the output array as we calculate them**.


This can be done in two steps:


1. First, populate the output array (`res`) the same way we populated `left_products`. This prepares the output array to be multiplied by the right products:


![Image represents a step-by-step calculation of the product of elements to the left of each element in an array.  The top line shows an array named `nums` containing the integer values [2, 3, 1, 4, 5]. Below it, `left_products` is an array initialized with the cumulative product of elements to the left of each corresponding element in `nums`, shown in gray.  The first element is 1 (as there are no elements to its left), the second is 2 (the product of the first element in `nums`), the third is 6 (2*3), the fourth is 6 (2*3*1), and the fifth is 24 (2*3*1*4). Finally, `res` is an array that appears to be a copy of `left_products`, displayed in black, with a gray arrow pointing to the right from the end of `res`, indicating the final result of the calculation.  The values in `res` are identical to those in `left_products`, suggesting that the calculation of the cumulative left products is complete and stored in `res`.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/prefix-sums/product-array-without-current-element/image-10-03-14-JGVIF7K3.svg)

2. Then, instead of populating a `right_products` array, we directly multiply the running product from the right (`right_product`) into the output array:


![Image represents a step-by-step illustration of a coding pattern, likely for calculating the product of array elements to the right of each element.  Two instances are shown, each depicting an array `nums` = [2, 3, 1, 4, 5] and an array `res` which is being populated.  The `res` array initially contains [1, 2, 6, 6, 24] in the first instance and [1, 2, 6, 30, 24] in the second.  A variable `right_product` is used; it starts at 1.  Each instance shows a dashed box containing calculations.  In the first instance, the calculation `res[i] = res[i] * right_product` updates `res[3]` (initially 6) to 24 by multiplying it with `right_product` (1). Then, `right_product` is updated to 5 (1 * 5).  The second instance shows a similar calculation, but now `res[3]` (initially 6) is updated to 30 (6 * 5), and `right_product` is updated to 20 (5 * 4).  Arrows indicate the flow of information:  the updated `right_product` value from one step feeds into the next step's calculation, and the updated `res[i]` value reflects the result of the calculation.  The `(i)` symbols above the `nums` arrays indicate the iteration index.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/prefix-sums/product-array-without-current-element/image-10-03-15-YYG3YCWG.svg)
