```python
Input: intervals = [[3, 4], [7, 8], [2, 5], [6, 7], [1, 4]]
Output: [[1, 5], [6, 8]]

```


#### Constraints:

- The input contains at least one interval.
- For every index `i` in the array, `intervals[i].start ≤ intervals[i].end`.

## Intuition


There are two main challenges to this problem:

- Identifying which intervals overlap each other.
- Merging those intervals.

Let's start by tackling the first challenge. Consider two intervals, A and B, where interval **A starts before B**. Below, we visualize the case when these two intervals don't overlap:


![Image represents a visualization of non-overlapping intervals on a number line.  The number line is labeled with integers from 1 to 8.  A thick black line labeled 'A' spans from approximately position 2 to 5 on the number line, with 'A.end' explicitly marking its right endpoint at 5.  Another thick black line labeled 'B' extends from approximately position 6 to 8, with 'B.start' clearly indicating its left endpoint at 6. A dashed light-blue line connects 'A.end' to 'B.start', visually representing the separation between the two intervals. The text 'Non-overlapping:' precedes the diagram, clarifying the relationship between the intervals A and B, emphasizing that they do not share any common points.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/intervals/merge-overlapping-intervals/image-09-01-1-5PZ4UDFJ.svg)

The dashed line above shows that interval A ends before interval B starts, which eliminates the possibility of B overlapping A. This indicates that **intervals A and B will never overlap when `A.end < B.start`**.


Now, consider a couple of cases where these two intervals do overlap:


![Image represents a diagram illustrating the 'Overlapping' coding pattern.  A horizontal number line, ranging from approximately 1 to 8, serves as the timeline. Two segments, labeled 'A' and 'B,' are depicted on this timeline. Segment 'A' extends from approximately point 2 to point 5, with 'A.end' explicitly marked at point 5. Segment 'B' starts at point 5 ('B.start') and ends at approximately point 7.  A dashed orange vertical line connects the end of segment A ('A.end') and the start of segment B ('B.start'), visually highlighting the point of overlap between the two segments.  The segments are represented by thick black horizontal lines with perpendicular lines at their start and end points. The overall arrangement demonstrates how the end of one process (A) coincides with the beginning of another (B), indicating an overlapping execution or dependency.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/intervals/merge-overlapping-intervals/image-09-01-2-CR72XXUV.svg)

In these cases, we see that B starts before (or when) A ends (`A.end ≥ B.start`). In other words, some portion of B overlaps A since interval A hasn't ended before interval B starts. Therefore, **intervals A and B overlap when `A.end ≥ B.start`**.


We have now established the two cases that cover all overlapping and non-overlapping scenarios for two intervals, given interval A starts before interval B:

- If `A.end < B.start`, the intervals don't overlap.
- If `A.end ≥ B.start`, the intervals overlap.

To apply these conditions to any two intervals in the input, it's useful to have a way to identify which interval starts first. One idea is to **sort the intervals by their start value**, which will make it clear which one of each two adjacent intervals starts first.


**Merging intervals**

With the above logic in mind, let's tackle an example. Consider the following intervals:


![Image represents a sequence of five distinct arrays, each enclosed in square brackets `[]` and containing two integer elements separated by a comma `,`.  The arrays are arranged horizontally, adjacent to one another without any intervening spaces.  The first array contains the integers 3 and 4; the second, 7 and 8; the third, 2 and 5; the fourth, 6 and 7; and the fifth, 1 and 4.  No information flows between the arrays; they are presented as independent data structures.  There are no URLs or parameters present.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/intervals/merge-overlapping-intervals/image-09-01-4-RWY6WP66.svg)

There are no URLs or parameters present.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/intervals/merge-overlapping-intervals/image-09-01-4-RWY6WP66.svg)


The first step is to sort these intervals by start value:


![Image represents a diagram illustrating a sorting operation on a list of sub-lists.  The top row shows five sub-lists, each containing two numbers: [3, 4], [7, 8], [2, 5], [6, 7], and [1, 4].  A downward-pointing arrow labeled 'sort' connects the top and bottom rows. The bottom row displays the same five sub-lists, but now each sub-list is sorted in ascending order: [1, 4], [2, 5], [3, 4], [6, 7], and [7, 8].  The diagram visually demonstrates the application of a sorting algorithm to each individual sub-list, leaving the order of the sub-lists themselves unchanged.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/intervals/merge-overlapping-intervals/image-09-01-5-TWSEFKHH.svg)

To aid the explanation, let's represent the intervals visually:


![Image represents a visualization of intervals on a number line.  The label 'intervals:' is positioned to the left of the diagram. A horizontal grey number line is shown, ranging from 1 to 8, marked with integer values. Above the number line are four horizontal grey line segments representing intervals. The first interval spans from approximately 1.2 to 4, the second from approximately 2 to 5, the third from approximately 3 to 3.5, and the fourth from approximately 6.5 to 7.5. Each interval is depicted as a line segment with small perpendicular lines at both ends, indicating the start and end points of the interval on the number line.  The intervals are not explicitly labeled but are visually distinct from each other and their positions relative to the numbered line clearly show their range.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/intervals/merge-overlapping-intervals/image-09-01-6-JCI47UVH.svg)

Let's add/merge each interval into a new array called merged, starting with the first one, which we can add to the merged array straight away as it's the first interval:


![Image represents a visual illustration of merging overlapping intervals.  The image displays a number line ranging from 1 to 8. Above the number line, labeled 'intervals:', are several horizontal gray line segments representing individual intervals.  These intervals are: a short segment spanning approximately 1.5 to 2.5, a longer segment from approximately 2 to 5, a shorter segment around 6 to 7, and a very short segment near 7.5 to 8. Below the number line, labeled 'merged:', is a single, longer orange line segment that spans from approximately 1 to 4. This orange segment represents the result of merging all overlapping gray intervals. Dotted vertical lines connect the endpoints of the longest gray interval (from 2 to 5) to the corresponding points on the merged orange interval, visually demonstrating the merging process. The gray intervals are shown to illustrate the input, while the orange interval shows the output after merging overlapping intervals.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/intervals/merge-overlapping-intervals/image-09-01-7-HI7DL6ZX.svg)

After the first interval is added, we start the process of merging. Let's define A as the last interval in the merged array and B as the current interval in the input. This makes sense since the interval in the merged array (A) starts before or at the same time as B.


We notice B starts before A ends, indicating an overlap. So, let's merge them:


![Image represents a visual explanation of interval merging in a coding pattern.  The image displays a number line spanning from 1 to 8. Above the number line, labeled 'intervals:', are two grey horizontal line segments representing intervals. The top segment, labeled 'B.start' and 'B', extends from approximately 2.5 to 4.5. The second segment extends from approximately 6 to 7. Below the number line, labeled 'merged:', is an orange horizontal line segment labeled 'A' and 'A.end', extending from approximately 1 to 5. To the right, a dashed-line box contains the condition 'A.end \u2265 B.start (overlap)' and an arrow pointing right indicating the action '\u2192 merge A and B'. This illustrates that if the end of interval A is greater than or equal to the start of interval B (indicating an overlap), then intervals A and B should be merged.  The visual representation clearly shows the relationship between the intervals and the merging logic.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/intervals/merge-overlapping-intervals/image-09-01-8-V2S5DGSR.svg)

When merging A and B, we use the leftmost start value and the rightmost end value between them. Since A will always start before or at the same time as B, we always use `A.start` as the start point. This means we just need to **identify the end point**, which is the **largest value between the end points of A and B**:

Below this, a light-orange segment labeled 'A' is shown, spanning from approximately 1 to 4.  Dashed light-blue arrows connect the end of interval A and the end of interval B to a final, merged orange interval below.

After processing the last interval, we've successfully merged all intervals.


## Implementation


```python
from typing import List
from ds import Interval
    
def merge_overlapping_intervals(intervals: List[Interval]) -> List[Interval]:
    intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x.start)
    merged = [intervals[0]]
    for B in intervals[1:]:
        A = merged[-1]
        # If A and B don't overlap, add B to the merged list.
        if A.end < B.start:
            merged.append(B)
        # If they do overlap, merge A with B.
        else:
            merged[-1] = Interval(A.start, max(A.end, B.end))
    return merged

```


```javascript
import { Interval } from './ds.js'

export function merge_overlapping_intervals(intervals) {
  if (intervals.length === 0) return []
  // Sort intervals by their start value
  intervals.sort((a, b) => a.start - b.start)
  const merged = [intervals[0]]
  for (let i = 1; i < intervals.length; i++) {
    const A = merged[merged.length - 1]
    const B = intervals[i]

    // If A and B don't overlap, add B to the merged list.
    if (A.end < B.start) {
      merged.push(B)
    } else {
      // If they do overlap, merge A with B.
      merged[merged.length - 1] = new Interval(A.start, Math.max(A.end, B.end))
    }
  }
  return merged
}

```


```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Collections;
import java.util.Comparator;
import core.Interval.Interval;

class Main {
    public static ArrayList<Interval> merge_overlapping_intervals(ArrayList<Interval> intervals) {
        if (intervals == null || intervals.size() == 0) return new ArrayList<>();
        // Sort intervals by their start time.
        intervals.sort(Comparator.comparingInt(a -> a.start));
        ArrayList<Interval> merged = new ArrayList<>();
        merged.add(intervals.get(0));
        for (int i = 1; i < intervals.size(); i++) {
            Interval B = intervals.get(i);
            Interval A = merged.get(merged.size() - 1);
            // If A and B don't overlap, add B to the merged list.
            if (A.end < B.start) {
                merged.add(B);
            }
            // If they do overlap, merge A with B.
            else {
                merged.set(merged.size() - 1, new Interval(A.start, Math.max(A.end, B.end)));
            }
        }
        return merged;
    }
}

### Complexity Analysis


**Time complexity:** The time complexity of merge_overlapping_intervals is O(nlog(n))O(nlog(n))O(nlog(n)), where nnn denotes the number of intervals. This is due to the sorting algorithm. The process of merging overlapping intervals itself takes O(n)O(n)O(n) time because we iterate over every interval.


**Space complexity:** The space complexity depends on the space used by the sorting algorithm. In Python, the built-in sorting algorithm, Tim sort, uses O(n)O(n)O(n) space. Note that the merged array is not considered in the space complexity calculation because we're only concerned with extra space used, not space taken up by the output.


### Interview Tip


*Tip: Visualize intervals to uncover logic and edge cases.*

Managing intervals and handling edge cases is much easier when visualizing example inputs. Drawing examples also helps your interviewer follow along with your reasoning and understand your thought process.
