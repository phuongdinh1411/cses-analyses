# Find the Median From Two Sorted Arrays

Given two sorted integer arrays, **find their median value** as if they were merged into a single sorted sequence.


#### Example 1:


```python
Input: nums1 = [0, 2, 5, 6, 8], nums2 = [1, 3, 7]
Output: 4.0

```


Explanation: Merging both arrays results in `[0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8]`, which has a median of (3 + 5) / 2 = 4.0.


#### Example 2:


```python
Input: nums1 = [0, 2, 5, 6, 8], nums2 = [1, 3, 7, 9]
Output: 5.0

```


Explanation: Merging both arrays results in `[0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`, which has a median of 5.


#### Constraints:

- At least one of the input arrays will contain an element.

## Intuition


The brute force approach to this problem involves merging both arrays and finding the median in this merged array. This approach takes O((m+n)log⁡(m+n))O((m+n)\log(m+n))O((m+n)log(m+n)) time where mmm and nnn denote the lengths of each array, respectively. This complexity is primarily due to the cost of sorting the merged array of length m+nm+nm+n. This approach can be improved to O(m+n)O(m+n)O(m+n) time by merging both arrays in order, which is possible because both arrays are already sorted. However, is there a way to find the median without merging the two arrays?


In this explanation, we use "total length" to refer to the combined length of both input arrays. Let's discuss odd and even total lengths separately, as these result in two different types of medians.


Consider the following two arrays that have an even total length:

Below is what these two arrays would look like when merged. Let's see if we can draw any insights from this.

Observe that the merged array can be divided into two halves, which reveals the median values on the inner edge of each half.

A challenge here is identifying which values in either input array belongs to the left half of the merged array, and which belong to the right half. One thing we do know is the size of each half of the merged array: **half of the total length**.


**Slicing both arrays**

To figure out which values belong to each half, we can try "slicing" both arrays into two segments, where the left segments of both arrays and the right segments of both arrays each have 4 total values. Let's refer to the values on the left and right of the slice as the "left partition" and "right partition." Below are three examples of what this slice could look like:


![Image represents a visual depiction of a partitioning algorithm, likely quicksort, showing the process of dividing an array into smaller sub-arrays.  Three stages are shown, each displaying an array represented as two horizontal rows of numbers enclosed in square brackets `[]`. The top row contains elements `[0, 2, 5, 6, 8]` in all three stages, while the bottom row contains `[1, 3, 7]` which remains constant.  The arrays are partitioned using two colored lines: light blue for the 'left partition' and light orange for the 'right partition'.  Triangles (pointing upwards) indicate pivot points within each partition.  Numbers above the lines indicate the lengths of the partitions. A curved arrow labeled 'slice' shows the movement of the partition boundaries, illustrating how the algorithm iteratively divides the array.  The legend clarifies that the arrow indicates data movement from the right partition to the left partition.  The initial array is implicitly divided into two partitions based on the pivot.  Subsequent stages show the refinement of these partitions, with the final stage suggesting a nearly sorted array.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/binary-search/find-the-median-from-two-sorted-arrays/image-06-05-4-4BIATGYJ.svg)

As we can see, there are several ways to slice the arrays to produce two partitions of equal size (4). However, only one of these slices corresponds to the halves of the merged array. In our example, it's this slice:


![Image represents a visual depiction of array splitting or partitioning.  The top section shows two 2D arrays, one light blue containing the elements [0, 2] in the first row and [1, 3] in the second, and the other peach-colored containing [5, 6, 8] in the first row and [7] in the second.  A vertical line separates these arrays.  Light blue horizontal lines with small triangles at their ends indicate the lengths of the rows in the light blue array (2 elements in the top row and 2 in the bottom). Similarly, orange lines with triangles show the lengths of the rows in the peach array (3 elements in the top row and 1 in the bottom). The numbers '2' and '3' above the arrays indicate the lengths of the respective rows. The bottom section displays the same elements arranged as two 1D arrays: a light blue array [0, 1, 2, 3] and a peach array [5, 6, 7, 8], separated by a vertical line, representing the concatenated elements from the original 2D arrays.  The diagram illustrates how a larger array might be conceptually divided into smaller sub-arrays, potentially for parallel processing or other algorithmic purposes.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/binary-search/find-the-median-from-two-sorted-arrays/image-06-05-5-CEVQSUY2.svg)

Let's refer to this as the "correct slice." We'll explain how to identify the correct slice shortly, but first, let's consider how to identify which slice correctly corresponds to the halves of the merged array.


**Determining the correct slice**


> An important observation is that all values in the left partition must be less than or equal to the values in the right partition.


We can assess this by comparing the two end values of the left partition with the start values of the right partition (illustrated below). Let's refer to the end values of the left partition as `L1` and `L2`, respectively. Similarly, let's call the start values of the right partition `R1` and `R2`.


![Image represents a diagram illustrating a coding pattern, likely related to array or list comparisons.  The diagram shows two rectangular regions, one light blue and one peach, representing potentially two different arrays or lists.  Each region contains several black dots representing elements, and two circled elements labeled L1, L2 (light blue) and R1, R2 (peach).  L1 and L2 are positioned at the right edge of their respective regions, while R1 and R2 are positioned at the left edge of their respective regions. A horizontal line connects the right edge of the light blue region to the left edge of the peach region. The text below the diagram specifies a condition to be checked:  `(L1 \u2264 R1, L1 \u2264 R2)` and `(L2 \u2264 R1, L2 \u2264 R2)`. This indicates a comparison where the values of L1 and L2 (from the light blue region) are checked to see if they are less than or equal to the values of R1 and R2 (from the peach region). The brackets `[` and `]` around the elements suggest that the regions represent ordered sequences, possibly arrays or lists.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/binary-search/find-the-median-from-two-sorted-arrays/image-06-05-6-SQUKHFCH.svg)

Since the values in each array are sorted, we know that conditions `L1 ≤ R1` and `L2 ≤ R2` are always true. Then, all we have to do is check that `L1 ≤ R2` and `L2 ≤ R1`. We can observe how this comparison reveals the correct slice from the previous three example slices:


![Image represents three examples illustrating a coding pattern, possibly related to array partitioning or range checks. Each example shows a numerical array enclosed in square brackets, partitioned into sub-arrays.  The first array in each example is split into two sub-arrays, with the partitioning point indicated by a vertical line.  Numbers within the array are represented by circles; light blue circles represent the lower bounds of sub-arrays, and peach circles represent upper bounds. Below each example is a small box containing two inequality checks.  The first example shows the array `[1, 3, 5, 6, 8]` partitioned at `5`, with checks `5 \u2264 3` (false, marked with 'x') and `1 \u2264 6` (true, marked with '\u2713'). The second example shows `[1, 3, 2, 5, 7]` partitioned at `2`, with checks `2 \u2264 7` (true, '\u2713') and `3 \u2264 5` (true, '\u2713'). The third example shows `[-\u221E, 1, 3, 6, 8]` partitioned at `6`, with checks `6 \u2264 1` (false, 'x') and `-\u221E \u2264 8` (true, '\u2713').  The pattern appears to involve checking inequalities based on the partitioning point and elements within the sub-arrays.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/binary-search/find-the-median-from-two-sorted-arrays/image-06-05-7-U2X6LK6S.svg)

Notice that in the third example above, the second array does not contribute any values to the left partition. So, to work around this, we set the second array's left value to - so that `L2 ≤ R1` is true by default.


**Searching for the correct slice**

Now, our goal is to search through all possible slices until we find the correct one. We do this by searching through all possible placements of `L1`, `R1`, `L2`, and `R2`. Note that we only need to **search for `L1`** since the other three values can be inferred based on `L1`'s index.


Let's take a closer look at how this works. Once we identify `L1`'s index, we can calculate `L2`'s index based on `L1`'s index, which is demonstrated in the diagram below. `R1` and `R2` are just the values immediately to the right of `L1` and `L2`, respectively.


![Image represents two diagrams illustrating a coding pattern, likely related to array partitioning.  Each diagram shows a horizontal array represented by square brackets containing dots (representing array elements) and labeled circular nodes. The left diagram shows a light-blue node labeled 'L1' connected by a downward arrow from a rectangular box labeled 'L1_index'.  'L1' is connected horizontally to a light-blue node labeled 'L2' via a line labeled 'R2'.  'L2' is connected by an upward arrow to a rectangular box labeled 'L2_index'. The right diagram mirrors this structure but with 'L1' and 'R1' (peach-colored) nodes in gray, indicating a different state.  A curved arrow connects 'L2_index' to 'R2', suggesting an iterative process. Below the diagrams, formulas describe the calculation of the number of left partition valves in two arrays, 'nums1' and 'nums2', based on 'L1_index' and 'half_total_len'.  The final formula defines 'L2_index' as a function of 'half_total_len' and 'L1_index'.  The diagrams visually represent the relationship between indices and array partitioning, while the formulas provide the mathematical logic behind the index calculations.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/binary-search/find-the-median-from-two-sorted-arrays/image-06-05-8-4G5CPYNZ.svg)

Since we search for `L1` over `nums1`, which is a sorted array, we can use **binary search** instead of searching for it linearly. The **search space** will encompass all values of the `nums1`.


Let's figure out how to **narrow the search space**. Here, we'll define the midpoint as `L1_index`, since it's also the index of `L1`. Let's discuss how the search space is narrowed based on these conditions:

- **If `L1 > R2`**, then `L1` is larger than it should be because we expect `L1` to be less than or equal to `R2`. To search for a smaller `L1`, narrow the search space toward the left:
- **If `L2 > R1`**, then `R1` is smaller than it should be because we expect `R1` to be less than or equal to `L2`. To search for a larger `R1`, narrow the search space toward the right:
- **If `L1 ≤ R2`, and `L2 ≤ R1`**, the correct slice has been located:

**Search space optimization**
A small optimization here is to ensure that `nums1` is the smallest array between the two input arrays. This ensures our search space is as small as possible. If `nums2` is smaller than `nums1`, we can just swap the two arrays, allowing `nums1` to always be the smaller array.


**Returning the median**

Once binary search has identified the correct slice, we need to return the median. With an even total length, the median is calculated using the array's two middle values. From our set of partition slice values (`L1`, `R1`, `L2`, and `R2`), which of them are the middle two? We know one of the median values is from the left partition and the other is from the right partition. From the left partition, the largest value between `L1` and `L2` will be closest to the middle. From the right, the smallest value between `R1` and `R2` is closer to the middle:

A curved arrow points from the 3 to indicate that it's the smallest element on the right, and another curved arrow points to the 3 from the left to indicate that it's the largest element on the left.

So, to return the median, we just return the sum of these two values, divided by 2 using floating-point division.


**What if the total length of both arrays is odd?**

The main difference when the total length of both arrays is odd compared to an even length is that we can no longer slice the arrays into two equal halves. One half must have an additional value.

The diagram above shows that the right half ends up with one extra value. This is because when we calculate the slice position, we ensure the left half has a size of half the total length. In this example, this calculation using integer division gives us a left half size of (5 + 4) // 2 = 4. Consequently, this means the right half ends up with 5 values. When the total length is odd, the median can be found in the right half:

The overall image illustrates a step in the merge sort process where the algorithm is combining sorted sub-arrays.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/binary-search/find-the-median-from-two-sorted-arrays/image-06-05-14-J2LJI2YA.svg)


So, after the binary search narrows down the correct slice, we can just return the smallest value between `R1` and `R2`.


![Image represents a visual illustration of a sorting algorithm, specifically highlighting a step where the smallest element is placed at the rightmost position.  Two arrays, represented as rows, are shown. The first array contains the numbers 0, 2, 5, 6, and 8, enclosed in square brackets.  The second array contains 0, 3, and 7, also enclosed in square brackets.  Numbers 2 and 3 are circled in light blue, while 5 and 7 are circled in a peach color. A vertical line separates the light blue circled numbers from the peach circled numbers and the remaining uncircled numbers. An orange arrow points from the text 'smallest on the right' to the peach-colored circle containing the number 5, indicating that 5 is the smallest element among the numbers to the right of the vertical line in the first array.  The arrangement visually demonstrates a partitioning step in a sorting algorithm, where smaller elements are moved to one side.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/binary-search/find-the-median-from-two-sorted-arrays/image-06-05-15-D74BESWU.svg)

## Implementation

    # Optimization: ensure 'nums1' is the smaller array.

        nums1, nums2 = nums2, nums1
    m, n = len(nums1), len(nums2)
    half_total_len = (m + n) // 2
    left, right = 0, m - 1
    # A median always exists in a non-empty array, so continue binary search until
    # it's found.
    while True:
        L1_index = (left + right) // 2

        R2 = float('inf') if L2_index >= n - 1 else nums2[L2_index + 1]
        # If 'L1 > R2', then 'L1' is too far to the right. Narrow the search space
        # toward the left.

        # toward the right.
        elif L2 > R1:
            left = L1_index + 1
        # If both 'L1' and 'L2' are less than or equal to both 'R1' and 'R2', we
        # found the correct slice.
        else:
            if (m + n) % 2 == 0:
                return (max(L1, L2) + min(R1, R2)) / 2.0
            else:
                return min(R1, R2)

### Complexity Analysis


**Time complexity:** The time complexity of `find_the_median_from_two_sorted_arrays` is O(log⁡(min(m,n)))O(\log(min(m,n)))O(log(min(m,n))) because we perform binary search over the smaller of the two input arrays.


**Space complexity:** The space complexity is O(1)O(1)O(1).


*Note: this explanation refers to the two middle values as "median values" to keep things simple. However, it's important to understand that these two values aren't technically "medians," as there's only ever one median. These are just the two values used to calculate the median.*
