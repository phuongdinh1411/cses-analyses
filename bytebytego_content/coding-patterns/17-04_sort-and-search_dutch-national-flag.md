# Dutch National Flag

Given an array of 0s, 1s, and 2s representing red, white, and blue, respectively, sort the array in place so that it resembles the Dutch national flag, with all **reds** (0s) coming first, followed by **whites** (1s), and finally **blues** (2s).


#### Example:


```python
Input: nums = [0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 0]
Output: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]

```


## Intuition


This problem is just asking us to sort three numbers in ascending order. A straightforward solution would be to use an in-built sorting function. However, this is an O(nlog⁡(n))O(n\log(n))O(nlog(n)) approach, where nnn denotes the length of the array. However, this isn’t taking advantage of an important problem constraint: there are only three types of elements in the array.


To sort these numbers, we essentially want to position all 0s to the left, all 2s to the right, and any 1s in between. A key observation is that if we place the 0s and the 2s in their correct positions, the 1s will automatically be positioned correctly:


![Image represents a visual explanation of a sorting algorithm, specifically illustrating how elements naturally group during the process.  The diagram shows an unsorted array `[2 0 1 2 0 0 1]` where numbers 0 are colored red, 1s are black, and 2s are cyan. A thick black arrow points to a sorted array `[0 0 0 1 1 2 2]`.  Underneath the sorted array, red and cyan horizontal brackets highlight the groups of 0s and 2s respectively, labeled 'sort 0s' and 'sort 2s' in their respective colors. Above the sorted array, a black bracket highlights the group of 1s, with the text '1s will naturally get sorted' explaining their position. The overall arrangement demonstrates how, without explicit sorting of 1s, the algorithm implicitly places them in their correct sorted position between the 0s and 2s.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/sort-and-search/dutch-national-flag/image-17-04-1-GHDXCMAE.svg)

This allows us to focus on only positioning two numbers.


One strategy we could use is to iterate through the array and move any 0s we encounter to the left, and any 2s we encounter to the right.


We can set a left pointer to move any 0s we encounter to the left, and a right pointer to move any 2s to the right. To iterate through the array, we can use a separate pointer, `i`:

- When we encounter a 0 at index `i`, swap it with `nums[left]`.
- When we encounter a 2 at index `i`, swap it with `nums[right]`.

To understand how we should adjust these pointers after each swap, let’s use the following example:


![Image represents a one-dimensional array or list depicted using square brackets `[]`.  The array contains seven integer elements: 2, 0, 1, 2, 0, 0, and 1. These elements are displayed in bold, black font and are arranged sequentially within the brackets. Below the array, a sequence of numbers from 0 to 6 is shown in a lighter gray font; these numbers represent the indices of the corresponding elements in the array, starting from index 0 for the first element (2) and ending at index 6 for the last element (1).  There is no explicit information flow or connections between the elements other than their sequential arrangement within the array structure indicated by the brackets and the implicit index mapping provided by the numbers below.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/sort-and-search/dutch-national-flag/image-17-04-2-2PJR5I3X.svg)

The first element is 2, so let’s swap it with `nums[right]`. Then, let’s move the right pointer inward so it points to where the next 2 should be placed:

Two labeled boxes, 'left' and 'i' (likely representing an index), point downward with arrows to an array `[2 0 1 2 0 0 1]`, indicating that the algorithm is focusing on the element at index `i` (which is 2 in this case).  A separate box labeled 'right' points to the last element of the array (1). A dashed-bordered box to the right details the algorithm's logic:  `nums[i] == 2` shows the value at index `i`; `\u2192 swap(nums[i], nums[right])` indicates that the algorithm will swap the element at index `i` (value 2) with the element at the 'right' index (value 1); and `\u2192 right--` shows that the 'right' index will be decremented after the swap.

Notice that after this swap, there’s now a new element at index `i`. So, we should not yet advance `i`, as we still need to decide whether this new element needs to be positioned elsewhere.

The pointer `i` is now pointing at a 1. We don’t need to handle any 1s we encounter, so let’s just advance the `i` pointer:

Now, pointer `i` is pointing at a 0, so let’s swap it with `nums[left]`:

After this swap, there’s a new element at index `i`. Since `i` is positioned after the left pointer, this element can only be a 1 for the following reasons:

- Before the swap, all 0s originally to the left of `i` would have already been positioned to the left of the `left` index.
- Before the swap, all 2s originally to the left of `i` would have already been positioned to the right of the `right` index.

Therefore, we can also advance the `i` pointer while advancing the `left` pointer.

We now know what to do whenever we encounter a 0, 1, or 2. We can continue applying this logic until the pointer `i` surpasses the `right` pointer, indicating all elements have been positioned correctly:

Note that we don’t stop the process when `i == right` because the `i` pointer could still be pointing at a 0, which would need to be swapped.

**Why do we advance both `i` and `left` pointers when we encounter a 0?**

A question we might have regarding the above process is why we advance the `i` pointer along with the `left` pointer when `nums[i] == 0`.


The reason becomes clear when we consider the following example:

The 'i' box, in black and white, also points to the same array's first element, suggesting an index or iterator. The 'right' source points to the element '1' in the array [1], with the index '3' shown below it.  The arrays are presented side-by-side, implying that the merge operation combines elements from two sorted sub-arrays ('left' and 'right') into a single sorted array.

Here, `nums[i] == 0`, so the first thing we do is swap `nums[i]` and `nums[left]`, which doesn’t change anything in this case since `left` and `i` point to the same element. Now, observe what happens if we only advance the left pointer:


![Image represents a visual depiction of a step in a sorting algorithm, likely a partitioning step within quicksort.  The left side shows an array `[0, 1, 2, 1]` with indices 0, 1, 2, and 3 displayed below.  A red box labeled 'left' points to the element at index 0 (value 0), and a gray box labeled 'i' points to the element at index 1 (value 1).  A red arrow indicates a connection from 'left' to the element at index 0, suggesting a pointer or index variable. A black arrow from 'i' also points to the element at index 1. A gray box labeled 'right' points to the element at index 3 (value 1). The right side shows a pseudocode block describing the algorithm's logic.  It checks if `nums[i]` (the element pointed to by 'i') is equal to 0. If true, it executes `swap(nums[i], nums[left])`, swapping the elements at indices `i` and `left`. Finally, it increments `left` using `left++`, moving the 'left' pointer one position to the right.  The overall diagram illustrates the process of partitioning an array based on a pivot value (likely 0 in this case) by comparing elements and swapping them to place elements smaller than the pivot to the left.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/sort-and-search/dutch-national-flag/image-17-04-14-GXOV2LP3.svg)

As we can see, the left pointer will surpass the `i` pointer, which shouldn’t happen since `i` needs to stay between `left` and `right` throughout the algorithm. To avoid this, we advance both the `i` and `left` pointers:

### Complexity Analysis


**Time complexity:** The time complexity of `dutch_national_flag` is O(n)O(n)O(n) because we iterate through each element of `nums` once.


**Space complexity:** The space complexity is O(1)O(1)O(1).
