# Introduction to Binary Search

## Intuition


Let's say you have a standard, hard-copy English dictionary, and you want to find the definition of the word "inheritance." How could we do this?


One approach is to flick through it page by page, until reaching the page with "inheritance." But this is inefficient, and realistically, you're more likely to immediately open a page somewhere in the middle.


Let's say you do this and land on a page of words beginning with "M." Realizing that "inheritance" is somewhere to the left of "M" in the alphabet, you open a page somewhere between the letters "A" and "M." You continue this process of checking if "inheritance" is to the right or left of the current page, and narrowing the search down until you find the correct page. With this method, you've significantly reduced the number of pages to be searched, in contrast to linearly turning every page in order. This is the fundamental concept of binary search.

## Implementing Binary Search


Binary search is an algorithm that searches for a value in a **sorted data set**.


Even experienced developers can find it quite tricky to implement binary search correctly because "the devil's in the detail."

- How should the boundary variables `left` and right be initialized?
- Should we use `left < right` or `left ≤ right` as the exit condition in our while-loop?
- How should the boundary variables be updated? Should we choose `left = mid`, `left = mid + 1`, `right = mid`, or `right = mid - 1`?

This chapter offers clear, intuitive guidance on how to master these challenges, and confidently handle even the trickiest edge case.


To begin any binary search implementation, do the following:

- Define the search space.
- Define the behavior inside the loop for narrowing the search space.
- Choose an exit condition for the while-loop.
- Return the correct value.

Let's break down these steps.


**1. Defining the search space**

The search space encompasses all possible values that may include the value we're searching for. For instance, when searching for a target in a sorted array, the search space should cover the entire array, as the target could be anywhere within it. This is illustrated in the array below, where the left and right pointers define the search space:


![Image represents a visual depiction of a search space within a binary search algorithm.  Two orange rectangular boxes labeled 'left' and 'right' are positioned above a horizontal line representing the 'search space'.  This space contains a sorted array of integers: [1, 3, 4, 9, 10, 12, 14, 17, 20].  Arrows descend from 'left' and 'right' pointing to the beginning and end of the array, respectively.  An orange line underneath the array is labeled 'search space,' indicating the range of values currently being considered during the search.  The diagram illustrates the initial state of a binary search, where the algorithm is about to begin its search for a target value within the defined 'search space'.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/binary-search/introduction-to-binary-search/image-06-00-2-PTGT2NKR.svg)

**2. Narrowing the search space**

Narrowing the search space involves progressively moving the left or right pointer inward until the search space is reduced to one element or none.


At each point in the binary search, we need to decide how we narrow our search space. We can either:

- **Narrow the search space toward the left** (by moving the right pointer inward):

To the right of the 'right' box's black dot, a sequence of three grey dots connected by light grey lines is shown, also enclosed in square brackets. A dashed orange curved arrow originates from the rightmost grey dot and points back towards the black dot associated with the 'right' box, suggesting a connection or data flow from the right-hand sequence back to the initial point.

The entire sequence of circles is enclosed within square brackets, suggesting a defined array or list.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/binary-search/introduction-to-binary-search/image-06-00-4-XHIO7BCT.svg)

Using the midpoint

We decide whether to move the left or right pointer based on the value in the middle of the search space, indicated by the midpoint variable (`mid`).


![Image represents a visual depiction of a data structure, likely an array or list, being accessed by three pointers labeled 'left,' 'mid,' and 'right.'  The pointers are represented by rectangular boxes with their respective labels in orange ('left,' 'right') and light blue ('mid').

The data structure itself is shown as a horizontal row of black dots enclosed in square brackets, representing individual elements. The 'left' pointer points to the first element, the 'right' pointer points to the last element, and the 'mid' pointer points to an element somewhere in the middle.  The arrangement suggests a scenario where these pointers might be used in algorithms like binary search or other operations requiring access to specific array positions.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/binary-search/introduction-to-binary-search/image-06-00-5-WLUFEYSC.svg)

The main question to ask at each iteration of binary search is: **is the value being searched for to the left or the right of the midpoint?**


Here's the general idea: if the value we're looking for is to the right of the midpoint, narrow the search space toward the right. Otherwise, narrow the search space toward the left.


To narrow the search space towards the right, there are two options:

- `left = mid + 1`

![Image represents a visual depiction of an algorithm, likely a binary search or a similar divide-and-conquer approach.  The diagram shows two phases. The first phase displays three rectangular boxes labeled 'left' (orange), 'mid' (light blue), and 'right' (orange), each pointing downwards with an arrow to a corresponding position within a sequence of dots representing an array.  The 'left' box points to the beginning of the array, 'mid' to the middle, and 'right' to the end. The second phase shows a transformation.  The initial array is partially redrawn, and a solid arrow with the label 'left = mid + 1' connects the rightmost dot of the left half of the array to the leftmost dot of the right half.  This indicates an update to the 'left' index.  Above the second phase, a light gray 'mid' box and orange 'left' and 'right' boxes are shown, pointing down to a smaller section of the array.  A dashed orange line connects the 'mid' box from the first phase to the 'left' box in the second phase, suggesting a relationship between the midpoint of the initial array and the new starting point of the search in the second phase.  The overall illustration demonstrates how an algorithm iteratively narrows down a search space by updating index pointers based on the midpoint.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/binary-search/introduction-to-binary-search/image-06-00-6-EAIFI3KQ.svg)

We do this if the midpoint value is definitively not the value we're looking for
and should **excluded** from the search space.

- `left = mid`
We do this if the midpoint value itself could potentially be the value we're looking
for and should still be **included** in the search space.

The exclude/include logic applies when narrowing the search space towards the left, as well (i.e., between `right = mid - 1` and `right = mid`).


Calculating the midpoint

In most cases, the midpoint is calculated using **`mid = (left + right) // 2`** in Python.[1](#user-content-fn-1) To lower the risk of integer overflow, `mid = left + (right - left) // 2` is preferred in many other languages.


**3. Choosing an exit condition**

Choosing an exit condition for when the while-loop should terminate can be tricky. Our choices are primarily between `left < right` and `left ≤ right`. Both conditions are applicable in different situations.

- When the exit condition is `left < right`, the while-loop will break when `left` and `right` meet.[2](#user-content-fn-2)
- On the other hand, `left ≤ right` ends once `left` has surpassed right.

![Image represents two diagrams illustrating different loop termination conditions in a search algorithm, likely binary search.  The left diagram shows a loop continuing 'while left < right', terminating 'once left == right'.  Two orange rectangular boxes labeled 'left' and 'right' are positioned above a series of dots within square brackets [...], representing an array or list. Arrows descend from 'left' and 'right' pointing to separate dots within the array, suggesting the pointers are converging. The right diagram shows a loop continuing 'while left \u2264 right', terminating 'once left > right'.  Similarly, two orange boxes labeled 'right' and 'left' (note the order change) are above a series of dots within square brackets [...]. Arrows descend from 'right' and 'left', again pointing to separate dots within the array, but this time illustrating the pointers potentially crossing each other before termination.  Both diagrams visually represent the iterative process of narrowing down a search space until a condition is met, highlighting the subtle difference in loop conditions and their impact on the final pointer positions.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/binary-search/introduction-to-binary-search/image-06-00-8-KNIVWZTT.svg)

When the left and right pointers meet after exiting the `left < right` condition, both converge to a single value. This is the final value in the search space after the binary search process is complete. This will be the exit condition we use throughout this chapter.


**4. Returning the correct value**

As previously mentioned, the while-loop **terminates once** **we've narrowed the search space down to a final value** (assuming no value was returned during earlier iterations), pointed at by both `left` and `right`:


![Image represents a visual depiction of a data structure, possibly illustrating a binary search or a similar algorithm.  The diagram shows a horizontal line representing a sorted sequence, with several small, grey circles evenly spaced along it, symbolizing data elements.  At the center of the line is a larger, black dot, indicating a pivot or search point. Above this central point are two rectangular boxes, colored orange, labeled 'left' and 'right,' respectively. Arrows point downwards from these boxes to the central black dot, suggesting that the 'left' box represents the portion of the sequence to the left of the pivot, and the 'right' box represents the portion to the right. The entire sequence is bounded by vertical brackets at either end, indicating the limits of the data set.  The arrangement visually communicates the partitioning of a sorted sequence around a pivot point, a common step in divide-and-conquer algorithms.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/binary-search/introduction-to-binary-search/image-06-00-9-WCSXVFIC.svg)

This final value is the answer we're looking for, assuming a valid answer exists.


## Time Complexity


The time complexity of the binary search is O(log⁡(n))O(\log(n))O(log(n)), where nnn is the number of values in the search space. The algorithm is logarithmic because, in each iteration of the algorithm, it divides the search space in half until a single value is located, or no value is found. This reduction by half in each step is characteristic of logarithmic behavior.


## Real-world Example


**Transaction search in financial systems:** In financial systems, a binary search can be used to quickly find a transaction or record by narrowing down the search range, as the data is typically stored in order. This makes it efficient to retrieve specific entries without searching through the entire database.


## Chapter Outline


Binary search has many applications, and we explore a range of problems covering various uses.


![Image represents a flowchart illustrating applications of the Binary Search algorithm.  The topmost box, 'Binary Search,' acts as the root, branching down into two main categories: 'Sorted Arrays' and 'Non-intuitive Search Space.'  The 'Sorted Arrays' box details finding the first and last occurrences of a number and determining the insertion index within a sorted array. This further leads to 'Partially Sorted Arrays,' focusing on finding a target within a rotated sorted array.  The 'Non-intuitive Search Space' box encompasses problems like 'Cutting Wood,' finding 'Local Maxima in Array,' and 'Weighted Random Selection.' This branch connects to 'Multiple Arrays,' which involves finding the median from two sorted arrays.
