# K Most Frequent Strings

Find the `k` most frequently occurring strings in an array, and return them sorted by frequency in descending order. If two strings have the same frequency, sort them in lexicographical order.


### Example:


```python
Input: strs = ['go', 'coding', 'byte', 'byte', 'go', 'interview', 'go'], k = 2
Output: ['go', 'byte']

```


#### Constraints:

- `k ≤ n`, where `n` denotes the length of the array.

## Intuition - Max-Heap


The two main challenges to this problem are:

- Identifying the `k` most frequent strings.
- Sorting those strings first by frequency and then lexicographically.

For now, let's concentrate on identifying the most frequent strings and address lexicographical ordering afterward.


First, we need a way to keep track of the frequencies of each string. We can use a hash map for this, where the keys represent the strings and the values represent frequencies:


![Image represents a data transformation process where a list of strings is converted into a frequency table.  The input is a list `[go coding byte byte go interview go]` containing the strings 'go', 'coding', 'byte', 'byte', 'go', 'interview', and 'go'. This list is shown to the left of a right-pointing arrow. The arrow indicates the flow of data from the input list to the output table. The output is a frequency table labeled 'freqs' with two columns: 'str' representing the unique strings and 'freq' representing their corresponding frequencies. The table lists 'go' with a frequency of 3, 'coding' with 1, 'byte' with 2, and 'interview' with 1.  The table visually summarizes the number of occurrences of each unique string from the input list.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/heaps/k-most-frequent-strings/image-08-01-1-76A7L6YR.svg)

The most straightforward approach is to obtain an array containing the strings from the hash map, sorted by frequency in descending order. The `k` most frequent strings would be the first `k` strings in this array.


![Image represents a data processing flow demonstrating the selection of the *k* most frequent elements from a dataset.  The process begins with a table labeled 'freqs' containing two columns: 'str' (string) and 'freq' (frequency).  The 'str' column lists strings: 'go', 'coding', 'byte', and 'interview', while the 'freq' column shows their corresponding frequencies: 3, 1, 2, and 1, respectively.  An arrow labeled 'sort' indicates a sorting operation transforming this table into a second 'freqs' table.  In this sorted table, the strings are reordered based on their frequencies in descending order: 'go', 'byte', 'coding', and 'interview' with frequencies 3, 2, 1, and 1.  A rectangular orange box highlights the top two rows ('go' and 'byte') of the sorted table. Finally, an arrow points from this highlighted section to the text 'k most frequent (k = 2)', signifying that the top *k* = 2 most frequent strings ('go' and 'byte') have been successfully extracted.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/heaps/k-most-frequent-strings/image-08-01-2-MQX5VDTE.svg)

The main inefficiency of this solution is that it involves sorting all n strings, even though we only need the top `k` frequent ones to be sorted.


Something useful to consider: if we remove the most frequent string, the new most frequent string after this removal represents the second-most frequent overall. By repeatedly identifying and removing the most frequent string `k` times, we efficiently obtain our answer.


To implement this idea, we need a data structure that allows efficient access to the most frequent string at any time. A **max-heap** is perfect for this.


**Max-heap**

Let's find the `k` most frequent strings from the previous input, this time using a max-heap. First, populate the heap with each string along with their frequencies.


![Image represents a data structure transformation illustrating the 'push all pairs' coding pattern.  The diagram shows two states: an initial state and a final state, both featuring a `max_heap` data structure. The initial state depicts a `max_heap` with an empty top rectangular section labeled `max:` indicating an empty maximum value container. The final state shows the same `max_heap` structure, but its top rectangular section now contains `max:` followed by the pair `(go, 3)`.  Below this, within the trapezoidal `max_heap` section, three additional pairs are listed: `(byte, 2)`, `(coding, 1)`, and `(interview, 1)`. A horizontal arrow labeled 'push all pairs' connects the initial and final states, indicating that all pairs from some unspecified source have been inserted into the `max_heap`, resulting in the final state where the pairs are ordered according to their second element (the numerical value), with the pair having the largest numerical value at the top.  The `max_heap` structure implies that the pairs are ordered such that the pair with the highest numerical value is at the top.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/heaps/k-most-frequent-strings/image-08-01-3-TWMWKWUP.svg)

One way to populate the heap is to push all `n` strings into it one by one, which will take O(nlog⁡(n))O(n\log(n))O(nlog(n)) time. Instead, we can perform the **heapify** operation on an array containing all the string-frequency pairs to create the max-heap in O(n)O(n)O(n) time.

To collect the `k` most frequent strings, pop off the top element from the heap `k` times and store the corresponding strings in the output array `res`:


![Image represents a step-by-step visualization of a top-k frequent element algorithm with k=2.  The process begins with a max-heap containing three elements: (go, 3), (byte, 2), and (coding, 1).  The top element, (go, 3), is identified by a `max:` label and an arrow indicates it's popped from the heap and added to a result list `res`, which initially is empty.  This results in a new max-heap containing (byte, 2), (coding, 1), and (interview, 1), and `res` now equals `[go]`.  The next iteration identifies (byte, 2) as the maximum, pops it, and adds it to `res`, yielding a max-heap with (coding, 1) and (interview, 1), and `res` becoming `[go, byte]`.  The algorithm stops here because k=2, and the final `res` list `[go, byte]` is returned, as indicated by an arrow labeled 'return'.  Each max-heap is visually represented as a trapezoid, clearly showing its elements.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/heaps/k-most-frequent-strings/image-08-01-4-UA5BSRV3.svg)

Now, we just need to ensure that when two strings have the same frequency, the one that comes first lexicographically has a higher priority in the heap. To do this, we can define a custom comparator for the heap that prioritizes strings lexicographically when their frequencies match, as demonstrated in the implementation below.


## Implementation - Max-Heap


We create a Pair class for string-frequency pairs, enabling us to customize priority using a custom comparator.


```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter
import heapq
    
class Pair:
   def __init__(self, str, freq):
       self.str = str
       self.freq = freq
    
   # Define a custom comparator.
   def __lt__(self, other):
       # Prioritize lexicographical order for strings with equal frequencies.
       if self.freq == other.freq:
           return self.str < other.str
       # Otherwise, prioritize strings with higher frequencies.
       return self.freq > other.freq
    
def k_most_frequent_strings_max_heap(strs: List[str], k: int) -> List[str]:
   # We use 'Counter' to create a hash map that counts the frequency of each string.
   freqs = Counter(strs)
   # Create the max heap by performing heapify on all string-frequency pairs.
   max_heap = [Pair(str, freq) for str, freq in freqs.items()]
   heapq.heapify(max_heap)
   # Pop the most frequent string off the heap 'k' times and return these 'k' most
   # frequent strings.
   return [heapq.heappop(max_heap).str for _ in range(k)]

```


```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.PriorityQueue;

class Pair {
    String str;
    int freq;

    public Pair(String str, int freq) {
        this.str = str;
        this.freq = freq;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public ArrayList<String> k_most_frequent_strings_max_heap(ArrayList<String> strs, int k) {
        // We use a HashMap to count the frequency of each string.
        Map<String, Integer> freqs = new HashMap<>();
        for (String s : strs) {
            freqs.put(s, freqs.getOrDefault(s, 0) + 1);
        }
        // Create a max heap using a custom comparator.
        PriorityQueue<Pair> maxHeap = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> {
            // Prioritize strings with higher frequencies.
            if (a.freq != b.freq) {
                return b.freq - a.freq;
            }
            // If frequencies are equal, prioritize lexicographically smaller strings.
            return a.str.compareTo(b.str);
        });
        // Add all string-frequency pairs to the max heap.
        for (Map.Entry<String, Integer> entry : freqs.entrySet()) {
            maxHeap.offer(new Pair(entry.getKey(), entry.getValue()));
        }
        // Pop the most frequent strings off the heap 'k' times.
        ArrayList<String> result = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < k && !maxHeap.isEmpty(); i++) {
            result.add(maxHeap.poll().str);
        }
        return result;
    }
}

```


### Complexity Analysis


**Time complexity:** The time complexity of `k_most_frequent_strings_max_heap` is O(n+klog⁡(n))O(n+k\log(n))O(n+klog(n)).

- It takes O(n)O(n)O(n) time to count the frequency of each string using `Counter`, and to build the `max_heap`.
- We also pop off the top of the heap kkk times, with each `pop` operation taking O(log⁡(n))O(\log(n))O(log(n)) time.

Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n)+kO(log⁡(n))=O(n+klog⁡(n))O(n)+kO(\log(n))=O(n+k\log(n))O(n)+kO(log(n))=O(n+klog(n)).


**Space complexity:** The space complexity is O(n)O(n)O(n) because the hash map and heap store at most nnn pairs. Note that the output array is not considered in the space complexity.


## Intuition - Min-Heap


As a follow up, your interviewer may ask you to modify your solution to reduce the space used by the heap.


In the previous approach, we ended up storing up to `n` items in the heap. However, since we only need the `k` most frequent characters, is there a way to maintain a heap with a space complexity of O(k)O(k)O(k)?


An important observation is that when our heap exceeds size k, we can **discard the lowest frequency strings until the heap's size is reduced to `k` again**. We can do this because those discarded strings definitely won't be among the k most frequent strings.


However, we can't implement this strategy with a max-heap because we won't have access to the lowest frequency string. Instead, we need to use a **min-heap**.

Let's observe how this works over an example:

To retrieve these strings, pop them from the heap until it's empty. Because we're using a min-heap, we're popping off the less frequent strings first. So, we need to reverse the order of the retrieved strings before returning the result:

A green arrow points from this final 'res' list to the text 'return reverse(res)', indicating that the algorithm concludes by returning the reversed version of the 'res' list.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/heaps/k-most-frequent-strings/image-08-01-10-G4DSTLYY.svg)

### Complexity Analysis


**Time complexity:** The time complexity of `k_most_frequent_strings_min_heap` is O(nlog⁡(k))O(n\log(k))O(nlog(k)).

- It takes O(n)O(n)O(n) time to count the frequency of each string using `Counter`.
- To populate the heap, we push nnn words onto it, with each `push` and `pop` operation taking O(log⁡(k))O(\log(k))O(log(k)) time. This takes O(nlog⁡(k))O(n\log(k))O(nlog(k)) time.
- Then, we extract kkk strings from the heap by performing the `pop` operation kkk times. This takes O(klog⁡(k))O(k\log(k))O(klog(k)) time.
- Finally, we reverse the output array, which takes O(k)O(k)O(k) time.

Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n)+O(nlog⁡(k))+O(klog⁡(k))+O(k)=O(nlog⁡(k))O(n)+O(n\log(k))+O(k\log(k))+O(k)=O(n\log(k))O(n)+O(nlog(k))+O(klog(k))+O(k)=O(nlog(k)).


**Space complexity:** The space complexity is O(n)O(n)O(n) because the hash map stores at most nnn pairs, whereas the heap only takes up O(k)O(k)O(k) space. The `res` array is not considered in the space complexity.
