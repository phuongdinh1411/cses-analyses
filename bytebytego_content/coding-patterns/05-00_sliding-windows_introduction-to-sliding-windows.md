# Introduction to Sliding Windows

## Intuition


*slides* across the data structure unidirectionally, typically searching for a subcomponent that meets a certain requirement.

Sliding windows are particularly valuable in scenarios where algorithms might otherwise rely on using two nested loops to search through all possible subcomponents to find an answer, resulting in an O(n2)O(n^2)O(n2) time complexity, or worse. When using a sliding window, the subcomponent(s) we’re looking for can usually be found in O(n)O(n)O(n) time, in comparison. But before discussing how they work, let’s establish some terminology:

- To **expand** the window is to advance the right pointer:
- To **shrink** the window is to advance the left pointer:
- To **slide** the window is to advance both the left and right pointers:
Note that sliding is equivalent to expanding and shrinking the window at the same time.

Now, let’s break down the two main types of sliding window algorithms:

- Fixed sliding window.
- Dynamic sliding window.

### Fixed Sliding Window


A fixed sliding window maintains a specific length as it slides across a data structure.


![Image represents a visual depiction of coding patterns related to window manipulation.  The image shows three sequential stages.  Each stage features a light-blue rectangular 'window' containing several black dots representing data elements, enclosed in square brackets.  Above each window, rectangular boxes labeled 'left' (in gray) and 'right' (in orange) indicate directional operations.  In the first stage, a gray 'left' box points down with a solid arrow to the leftmost dot, while an orange 'right' box points down with a dashed orange arrow to a dot near the right edge.  The text below the first window reads 'expand window to desired size,' indicating that the window expands to accommodate new data.  The second and third stages depict a 'slide' operation.  Here, the 'left' and 'right' boxes point to the leftmost and rightmost dots respectively, using dashed orange arrows.  The text 'slide' appears below the second and third windows.  Solid black arrows connect the stages, showing the transition from expanding the window to sliding it.  The overall diagram illustrates how data is added to (expand) and then moved within (slide) a window, showcasing different data manipulation techniques.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/sliding-windows/introduction-to-sliding-windows/image-05-00-5-YHDQJSFH.svg)

We use the fixed sliding window technique when the problem asks us to **find a subcomponent of a certain length**. If we know what this length is, we can fix our window to that length and slide it through the array.


> If a fixed window of length k traverses a data structure from start to finish, it’s guaranteed to see every subcomponent of length k in that data structure.


Below is a generic template of how a fixed sliding window traverses a data structure.


```python
left = right = 0
while right < n:
    # If the window has reached the expected fixed length, we slide the window (move
    # both left and right).
    if right - left + 1 == fixed_window_size:
        # Process the current window.
        result = process_current_window()
        left += 1
    right += 1

```


```javascript
let left = 0
let right = 0
while (right < n) {
  // If the window has reached the expected fixed length, we slide the window (move
  // both left and right).
  if (right - left + 1 === fixed_window_size) {
    // Process the current window.
    result = process_current_window()
    left += 1
  }
  right += 1
}

```


```java
int left = 0, right = 0;
while (right < n) {
    // If the window has reached the expected fixed length, we slide the window (move
    // both left and right).
    if (right - left + 1 == fixedWindowSize) {
        // Process the current window.
        ResultType result = processCurrentWindow();
        left++;
    }
    right++;
}

```


### Dynamic Sliding Window


Unlike fixed sliding windows, dynamic windows can expand or shrink in length as they traverse a data structure.


![Image represents a sequence of three diagrams illustrating a data structure manipulation.  The first diagram shows a light-blue rounded rectangle representing a data structure containing several black dots, enclosed in square brackets.  A grey box labeled 'left' points down with an arrow to the leftmost dot, and an orange box labeled 'right' points down with an arrow to a dot near the right edge.  Orange dashed lines connect the dots, indicating an expansion of the structure. The label 'expand' is below the rectangle.  A solid arrow points to the second diagram, which shows the same structure but with fewer dots, labeled 'shrink,' indicating a reduction in size.  The 'left' and 'right' boxes similarly point to the leftmost and rightmost dots, respectively.  Finally, a solid arrow leads to the third diagram, which is identical in structure to the first, again labeled 'expand,' showing the data structure expanding again.  The 'left' and 'right' boxes maintain their positions and directional arrows.  The overall sequence demonstrates a dynamic data structure that can expand and shrink, with the 'left' and 'right' labels possibly indicating pointers or access points to the structure's boundaries.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/sliding-windows/introduction-to-sliding-windows/image-05-00-6-JR24WU57.svg)

Generally, dynamic sliding windows can be applied to problems that ask us to **find the longest or shortest subcomponent that satisfies a condition** (for example, a condition could be that the numbers in the window must be greater than 10).


When finding the longest subcomponent, the dynamics of expanding and shrinking are typically as follows:

- If a window satisfies the condition, expand it to see if we can find a longer window that also meets the condition.
- If the condition is violated, shrink the window until the condition is met again.

Below is a generic template demonstrating how this works:


```python
left = right = 0
while right < n:
    # While the condition is violated, the window is invalid, so shrink the window by
    # advancing the left pointer.
    while condition is violated:
        left += 1
    # Once the window is valid, process it and then expand the window by advancing the
    # right pointer.
    result = process_current_window()
    right += 1

```


```javascript
let left = 0;
let right = 0;
while (right < n) {
  // While the condition is violated, the window is invalid, so shrink the window by
  // advancing the left pointer.
  while (condition is violated) {
    left += 1;
  }
  // Once the window is valid, process it and then expand the window by advancing the
  // right pointer.
  result = process_current_window();
  right += 1;
}

```


```java
int left = 0, right = 0;
while (right < n) {
    // While the condition is violated, the window is invalid, so shrink the window by
    // advancing the left pointer.
    while (conditionIsViolated()) {
        left++;
    }
    // Once the window is valid, process it and then expand the window by advancing the
    // right pointer.
    ResultType result = processCurrentWindow();
    right++;
}

```


Note that the provided templates for fixed and dynamic windows primarily emphasize the movement of the left and right pointers rather than the specifics of updating the window itself. If the problem requires updating the window, the logic around it will be highly context-dependent. This is explored in detail through specific problems in this chapter.


## Real-world Example


**Buffering in video streaming**: In video streaming, a dynamic sliding window can be used to manage buffering and ensure smooth playback.
