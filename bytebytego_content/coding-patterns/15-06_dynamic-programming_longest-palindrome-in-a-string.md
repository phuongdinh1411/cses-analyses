# Longest Palindrome in a String

Return the **longest palindromic substring** within a given string.


#### Example:


```python
Input: s = 'abccbaba'
Output: 'abccba'

```


## Intuition


A naive solution to this problem is to check every possible substring and save the longest palindrome found. It takes approximately O(n2)O(n^2)O(n2) time to generate all substrings for a string of length nnn, and for each of these substrings, it takes O(n)O(n)O(n) time to check if it’s a palindrome. This results in an overall time complexity of O(n3)O(n^3)O(n3), which is expensive. So, we should consider a more efficient approach.


**Determining if a substring is a palindrome**

An important observation is that palindromes contain shorter palindromes within them. We can observe this in the string “rotator”, for example:


![Image represents a visual depiction of a palindrome check.  The top row displays the input string 'rotor', with the letters 'r', 'o', 't', 'a', 't', 'o', and 'r' arranged sequentially from left to right.  The letters 'o', 't', 'a', 't', and 'o' are shown in light blue, suggesting they are being processed or are part of a subset. A horizontal gray line underlines the light blue letters, visually separating them from the outer 'r's. A downward-pointing gray arrow extends from the center of this line, pointing to the word 'palindrome' written below in a gray font. This arrangement illustrates that the input string 'rotor' is being checked for palindromic properties, with the central portion ('otato') being the focus of the check, and the result of the check (that it is a palindrome) is indicated below.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/dynamic-programming/longest-palindrome-in-a-string/image-15-06-1-F5KQT7DX.svg)

This highlights a subproblem: to identify if a string is a palindrome, we can check if its inner substring is also a palindrome.


More specifically, a substring from index `i` to `j` is a palindrome given two conditions:

- Its first and last characters are the same (`s[i] == s[j]`).
- The substring from index `i + 1` to `j - 1` (`s[i + 1 : j - 1]`) is also a palindrome.

![Image represents a visual explanation of a palindrome-checking algorithm.  The core element is a string 'rotor' displayed in light blue, representing the input string 's'.  Two orange boxes labeled 'i' and 'j' act as pointers, initially pointing to the first ('r') and last ('r') characters of the string, respectively.  Dashed grey arrows indicate the flow of comparison:  'i' points downwards to the 'r' at the beginning, and 'j' points downwards to the 'r' at the end.  Above the string, 's[i] == s[j]' in orange text signifies the comparison of characters at indices 'i' and 'j'.  If the characters are equal (as they are in this case), the algorithm proceeds.  Below the string, 's[i + 1 : j - 1]' in orange and black text indicates the substring remaining after the initial comparison, which is 'ota to'.  This substring is declared to be a palindrome, implying that the algorithm recursively checks this substring for the same condition until either a mismatch is found or the substring becomes empty, confirming the original string's palindrome status.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/dynamic-programming/longest-palindrome-in-a-string/image-15-06-2-NYRJU2II.svg)

The only situation where this isn’t true is when the substring is of length 0, 1, or 2, in which case there is no inner substring. We’ll discuss these cases later.


This problem has an **optimal substructure** since we solve a subproblem to obtain the solution to the main problem. This indicates that DP is well-suited for solving this problem. Let’s say that `dp[i][j]` tells us if the substring `s[i : j]` is a palindrome. Based on our earlier observations, we can say that:


> `dp[i][j] = True if s[i] == s[j] and dp[i + 1][j - 1]`


Naturally, we need to specify the base cases for this formula.


**Base cases**

We mentioned earlier that substrings of length 1 and 2 have no inner substrings. In other words, there are no further subproblems to solve when determining if they are palindromes. As such, these substrings define our base cases:

- Base case: All substrings of length 1 are palindromes. So, set `dp[i][i]` to true for all values of `i`.
- Base case: Substrings of length 2 are palindromes if both its characters are the same. So, set `dp[i][i + 1]` to true if `s[i] == s[i + 1]`.

With the base cases set up, let’s discuss how to populate the rest of the DP table.


**Populating the DP table**

Determining if longer substrings are palindromes depends on the DP values of shorter substrings. Therefore, we should populate the DP table for the shortest substrings first, starting with checking all substrings of length 3 and working our way up to length n, where n denotes the length of the input string.


**Keeping track of the longest palindromic substring**

As we populate the DP table, we also need to keep track of the longest palindromic substring encountered. We use two variables for this: `start_index` and `max_len`.

- `start_index`: stores the starting index of the longest palindromic substring found so far
- `max_len`: stores the length of the longest palindromic substring found so far

When we find a new, longer palindromic substring, we update these two variables. By the end, `start_index` and `max_len` will indicate the position and length of the longest palindrome.


Finally, return the substring using `s[start_index : start_index + max_len]`.


This solution is a classic example of “interval DP,” which is used to solve optimization problems involving subproblems over intervals of data. In this case, the “intervals” are effectively the substrings between indexes `i` and `j`.


## Implementation


```python
def longest_palindrome_in_a_string(s: str) -> str:
    n = len(s)
    if n == 0:
        return 
    dp = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
    max_len = 1
    start_index = 0
    # Base case: a single character is always a palindrome.
    for i in range(n):
        dp[i][i] = True
    # Base case: a substring of length two is a palindrome if both characters are the
    # same.
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if s[i] == s[i + 1]:
            dp[i][i + 1] = True
            max_len = 2
            start_index = i
    # Find palindromic substrings of length 3 or greater.
    for substring_len in range(3, n + 1):
        # Iterate through each substring of length 'substring_len'.
        for i in range(n - substring_len + 1):
            j = i + substring_len - 1
            # If the first and last characters are the same, and the inner substring
            # is a palindrome, then the current substring is a palindrome.
            if s[i] == s[j] and dp[i + 1][j - 1]:
                dp[i][j] = True
                max_len = substring_len
                start_index = i
    return s[start_index : start_index + max_len]

```

### Complexity Analysis


**Time complexity:** The time complexity of `longest_palindrome_in_a_string` is O(n2)O(n^2)O(n2) because each cell of the n⋅nn\cdot nn⋅n DP table is populated once.


**Space complexity:** The space complexity is O(n2)O(n^2)O(n2) because we're maintaining a DP table that has n2n^2n2 elements. Note, the output string is not considered in the space complexity.


## Optimized Approach


An important observation of the previous approach is that the base cases represent the centers of palindromes. Understanding this, another possible strategy is to expand outward from each base case to find the longest palindrome.


There are two types of base cases: single-character substrings and two-character substrings. We can treat each as the center of potential palindromes, and expand outward from each of them to find these palindromes.


We can do this by setting left and right pointers at the center, expanding them outward – as long as the characters at both pointers match – and stopping once they can no longer form a larger palindrome. Here are two examples of this:

All we need to do is keep track of the start index and length of the longest palindromic we find, just as in the previous approach.


This approach makes use of some of the information from the previous DP approach, while solving the problem using constant space.

### Complexity Analysis


**Time complexity:** The time complexity of `longest_palindrome_in_a_string_expanding` is O(n2)O(n^2)O(n2) because expanding from the center of a base case takes up to O(n)O(n)O(n) time. Doing this for each base case takes O(n2)O(n^2)O(n2) time.


**Space complexity:** The space complexity is O(1)O(1)O(1) since we aren’t maintaining any auxiliary data structures. The output string is not considered in the space complexity.


## Manacher’s Algorithm


Aside from the above quadratic-time solutions, there's a more efficient algorithm for finding the longest palindromic substring: Manacher's Algorithm. This algorithm runs in O(n)O(n)O(n) time.


However, Manacher's Algorithm's specialized nature makes it less common in coding interviews. Most interviewers want to see solutions that show you deeply understand basic concepts and have strong problem-solving skills. They are less interested in tricky solutions that would be unlikely for candidates to come up with during interviews.
