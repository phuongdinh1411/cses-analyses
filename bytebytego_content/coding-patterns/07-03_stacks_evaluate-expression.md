# Evaluate Expression

Given a string representing a mathematical expression containing integers, parentheses, addition, and subtraction operators, evaluate and return the result of the expression.


#### Example:


```python
Input: s = '18-(7+(2-4))'
Output: 13

```


## Intuition


At first, it might seem overwhelming to deal with expressions that include a variety of elements like negative numbers, nested expressions inside parentheses, and numbers with multiple digits. The key to managing this complexity is to break down the problem into smaller, more manageable parts. Let's first focus on evaluating simple expressions that contain no parentheses.


**Handling positive and negative signs**

Consider the following expression:


![Image represents a simple arithmetic expression displayed linearly.  The expression consists of the number 28, a minus sign (-), the number 10, a plus sign (+), and the number 7. These elements are arranged sequentially from left to right, indicating the order of operations.  No explicit connections or information flow are depicted beyond the implied mathematical relationship between the numbers and operators. The expression suggests a calculation where 28 is subtracted by 10 and then added to 7.  There are no URLs or parameters present.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/stacks/evaluate-expression/image-07-03-1-AMDAEXRA.svg)

There's already some complexity in this expression with there being two signs to consider: plus and minus. An immediate simplification we can make is to **treat all expressions as ones of pure addition**. This is possible when we assign signs to each number (1 representing + and -1 representing -). This sign can be multiplied by the number to attain its correct value. This allows us to just focus on performing additions:


![Image represents three separate instances demonstrating a concept likely related to signed numbers or data. Each instance consists of a pair of numbers and a sign indicator.  The first instance shows a plus sign `(+)` followed by the numbers `2` and `8`, with a grey curved arrow pointing upwards to the text 'sign = 1' above it, indicating a positive sign. The second instance displays a minus sign `(-)` followed by the numbers `1` and `0`, similarly linked by a grey curved arrow to 'sign = -1' above, representing a negative sign. The third instance mirrors the first, with a plus sign `(+)` followed by the number `7`, and an upward-pointing grey curved arrow connected to 'sign = 1', again indicating a positive sign.  The arrangement suggests a pattern where the sign value (`1` or `-1`) is associated with a pair of numbers, possibly representing a magnitude and an additional data point, or a single number with a sign.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/stacks/evaluate-expression/image-07-03-2-5HZOEGR7.svg)

**Processing numbers with multiple digits**

Another complexity in this expression is that some numbers have multiple digits. We’ll need a way to build numbers digit by digit until we reach the end of the number. We can build a number using the variable `curr_num`, which is initially set to 0. Every time we encounter a new digit, we multiply `curr_num` by 10 and add the new digit to it, effectively shifting all digits to the left and appending the new digit.


We can see this process play out for the string “123” in the following illustration:

Below this, a dashed-line rectangle contains a formula: `curr_num = 10 * curr_num + digit`.  This formula shows how a running number (`curr_num`) is updated iteratively.  Below the formula, a step-by-step calculation is shown for the first digit (1): `curr_num = 0 + 1`, and the result `curr_num = 1`. This implies that the process starts with `curr_num` initialized to 0, and each digit is incorporated into `curr_num` by multiplying the current value of `curr_num` by 10 and adding the new digit.  The diagram visually demonstrates how the algorithm converts a sequence of digits into a numerical value.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/stacks/evaluate-expression/image-07-03-3-HTLV5ZR2.svg)

We can stop building this number once we encounter a non-digit character, indicating the end of the number.


**Evaluating an expression without parentheses**

With the information from the section above, let's evaluate the following expression, which contains no parentheses. We’ll start off with a sign of 1:


![Image represents a snapshot of a program's state during execution, likely illustrating a coding pattern related to numerical processing or string manipulation.  The image shows a sequence of numbers '2 8 - 1 0 + 7,' suggesting a numerical expression being processed.  This is followed by two variable assignments: 'sign = 1,' indicating a positive sign, and 'curr_num = 0,' representing a current numerical value initialized to zero. The arrangement suggests that the numerical sequence is input data, and the variables 'sign' and 'curr_num' are internal program variables storing intermediate results.  There's no explicit connection shown between the numerical sequence and the variables, implying an implicit processing step where the program iterates through the sequence, updating 'sign' and 'curr_num' based on the operators (+, -, etc.) encountered.  The comma after '7' might indicate the end of the input sequence or a delimiter.  The overall structure suggests a step-by-step processing of a numerical expression, possibly part of a larger algorithm.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/stacks/evaluate-expression/image-07-03-6-CAOKQBKM.svg)

Upon reaching the ‘-’ operator, we’ve reached the end of the first number (28). So, let’s:

- Multiply the current number (28) by its sign (1).
- Add the resulting product (28) to the result.
- Update the sign to -1 since the current operator is a minus sign.
- Reset `curr_num` to 0 before building the next number.

Above the '28' is a plus sign within a dashed circle, connected by an upward-pointing arrow to 'sign = 1', indicating a positive sign. Below the '28' is 'curr_num = 28', showing the current numerical value. The right side shows a code snippet illustrating the calculation: `res += sign * curr_num`, where `res` is a result variable, `sign` holds the sign (+1 or -1), and `curr_num` holds the current number.  The calculation steps show `+= 28` (adding 28 to `res`), resulting in `= 28`. Below, it shows the updated values: `sign = -1, curr_num = 0`, indicating the sign has changed and the current number is reset to 0 after processing '28'. The overall diagram demonstrates how a numerical string is processed iteratively, updating the sign and current number in each step.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/stacks/evaluate-expression/image-07-03-7-XLYYJDZQ.svg)

Once we reach the second operator, we multiply the current number (10) by its sign of -1 before adding the resulting product (-10) to the result. This effectively subtracts 10 from the result:

Finally, once we’ve reached the end of the string, we just add the final number (7) to the result after multiplying it by its sign of 1:

**Evaluating expressions containing parentheses**

Now that we can solve simple expressions, it's time to bring parentheses into the discussion. Moving forward, we define a nested expression as one that’s inside a pair of parentheses.


One challenge is that we need to evaluate the results of nested expressions before we can calculate the original expression. Once all nested expressions are evaluated, we can evaluate the original expression.

Then, an opening parenthesis introduces a nested expression: 7 plus an inner parenthesized expression (highlighted in peach) containing '2 - 4'. This inner expression is underlined with an orange line, indicating it's a sub-problem to be solved first. A downward-pointing orange arrow extends from this underline to the word 'solve' written in orange below, explicitly showing the flow of computation.

Consider another problem in this chapter that also contains parentheses: *Valid Parenthesis Expression*. In that problem, we used a **stack** to process nested parentheses in the right order. This suggests a stack might also help us evaluate nested expressions in the right order. Let’s explore this idea further.


Similar to *Valid Parenthesis Expression*, an opening parenthesis ‘`(`‘ indicates the start of a new nested expression, whereas a closing parenthesis ‘`)`’ indicates the end of one. Understanding this, let’s try to use a stack to solve the following expression.


![Image represents a visual explanation of arithmetic expression evaluation using a stack data structure.

We already know how to evaluate expressions without parentheses, so let’s just focus on what to do when we encounter a parenthesis.


At the first opening parenthesis, we know a nested expression has started. Before we evaluate the nested expression, we’ll need to save the running result (`res`) of the current expression, as well as the sign of this upcoming nested expression. This way, once we’re done evaluating the nested expression, we can resume where we were in the current expression.


Here are the steps for when we encounter an opening parenthesis:

- `stack.push(res)`: Save the running result on the stack.
- `stack.push(sign)`: Save the sign of the upcoming nested expression on the stack.
- `res = 0`, `sign = 1`: Reset these variables because we’re about to begin calculating a new expression.

![Image represents a diagram illustrating a coding pattern, likely for evaluating arithmetic expressions using a stack.  The left side shows an arithmetic expression `(7 + (2 - 4))` being processed.  Variables `res` (initially 18) and `sign` (initially -1) are shown, with an arrow indicating that `res` is updated.  A dashed box encloses the numbers 1 and 8, suggesting these are processed first.  An orange arrow points from a small orange square labeled 'i' to the expression, indicating an input or starting point. The middle section depicts a stack data structure, visually represented as an empty container labeled 'stack'. The right side shows a gray box with dashed borders outlining the actions performed on the stack: `stack.push(res)` pushes the value of `res` onto the stack, `stack.push(sign)` pushes the value of `sign`, and finally, 'reset res and sign' indicates that these variables are reset after the stack operations.

The next parenthesis we encounter is an opening parenthesis. Again, this indicates the start of a new nested expression. Let’s save the current result and sign on the stack, before resetting them to evaluate the upcoming nested expression:

The next parenthesis we encounter is a closing parenthesis. This means the current nested expression just ended, and we need to merge its result with the outer expression. Here’s how we do this:

- `res *= stack.pop()`: Apply the sign of the current nested expression to its result.
- `res += stack.pop()`: Add the result of the outer expression to the result of the current nested expression.

![Image represents a visual explanation of postfix expression evaluation using a stack.  The left side shows the postfix expression '1 8 - ( 7 + ( 2 - 4 ) )', with the subexpression '( 2 - 4 )' highlighted in orange dashed lines and its result, -2, indicated with an orange upward-pointing arrow.  A small orange box labeled 'i' points downward to this -2, suggesting an intermediate calculation.  The middle section depicts a stack data structure, initially containing the numbers 18, -1, 7, and 1.  Purple arrows labeled 'pop' show the elements being popped from the stack.  The rightmost section demonstrates the calculation steps:  first, `res *= stack.pop()` calculates `res` (initially 0, implied) as 1 * 1 = 1, then `res` becomes -2 after `*= 1`.  Next, `res += stack.pop()` adds 7 to `res`, resulting in 5.  The overall process illustrates how the stack is used to evaluate the postfix expression, with operands pushed onto the stack and operators popping operands to perform calculations, ultimately yielding the final result.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/stacks/evaluate-expression/image-07-03-20-IVQFHLMJ.svg)

After applying those operations, the value of `res` will be 5, representing the result of the highlighted part of the expression below:

At the final closing parenthesis, we can apply the same steps:


![Image represents a visual explanation of evaluating an arithmetic expression using a stack.  The expression '1 8 - (7 + (2 - 4))' is shown, with the innermost parentheses ' (2 - 4)' highlighted in an orange dashed box.

The numbers from the expression are pushed onto the stack as they are encountered.  A purple arrow shows the value '1' being popped from the stack, followed by '18' also being popped.  A separate box on the right details the calculation steps: first, the top of the stack (-1) is multiplied by the result (initially 0), resulting in -5.

### Complexity Analysis


**Time complexity:** The time complexity of `evaluate_expression` is O(n)O(n)O(n) because we traverse each character of the expression once, processing nested expressions using the stack, where each stack push or pop operation takes O(1)O(1)O(1) time.


**Space complexity:** The space complexity is O(n)O(n)O(n) because the stack can grow proportionally to the length of the expression.
