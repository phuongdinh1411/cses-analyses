# Substring Anagrams

Given two strings, `s` and `t` , both consisting of lowercase English letters, return the number of substrings in `s` that are **anagrams of `t`**.


An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of another word or phrase, using all the original letters exactly once.


#### Example:


```python
Input: s = 'caabab', t = 'aba'
Output: 2

```


Explanation: There is an anagram of `t`


## Intuition


We can reframe how we think about an anagram by altering the provided definition. A substring of s qualifies as an anagram of t if it contains exactly the same characters as t in any order.


For a substring in s to be an anagram of t, it must have the same length as t (denoted as `len_t`). This means we only need to consider substrings of s that match the length `len_t`, which saves us from examining every possible substring.


To examine all substrings of a **fixed length**, `len_t`, we can use the **fixed sliding window** technique because a window of `len_t` is guaranteed to slide through every substring of this length. We can see this in the example below:


![Image represents a visual depiction of a sliding window algorithm, likely for string manipulation or pattern matching, where `len_t = 3` defines the window size.  The diagram shows four stages. Each stage features two orange rectangular boxes labeled 'left' and 'right,' representing pointers or indices at the beginning and end of a sliding window, respectively.  Arrows descend from these boxes to a light-blue rectangular box containing a sequence of characters ('c', 'a', 'a', 'b', 'a', 'b').  The sequence represents the input string.  In each stage, the window, indicated by the light-blue box, slides one position to the right. The first stage shows the window encompassing 'c', 'a', 'a'. The second stage shows the window shifted to 'a', 'a', 'b'. The third stage shows 'a', 'b', 'a'. The fourth stage shows 'b', 'a', 'b'.  Gray arrows separate the stages, indicating the progression of the sliding window across the input string.  The algorithm appears to be processing the string in a left-to-right manner, with the window size remaining constant at 3.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/sliding-windows/substring-anagrams/image-05-01-1-LANW6IHP.svg)

Now, we just need a way to check if a window is an anagram of t. Remember that in an anagram, the order of the letters doesn’t matter; only the **frequency of each letter** does. By comparing the frequency of each character in a window against the frequencies of characters in string t, we can determine if that window is an anagram of t.


Let's explore this reasoning with an example. Before starting the sliding window algorithm, we need a way to store the frequencies of the characters in string t. We could use a hash map for this, or an array, `expected_freqs`, to store the frequencies of each character in string t.


> `expected_freqs` is an integer array of size 26, with each index representing one of the lowercase English letters (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', and so on, up to 25 for 'z').


![Image represents a diagram illustrating the concept of frequency counting in a string.  The diagram shows a string `s = 'caababb'` and a target string `t = 'aba'`.  Curved arrows connect the characters of `t` to a frequency array labeled `expected_freqs`. This array represents the expected frequencies of characters in `t`.  Specifically, the array `expected_freqs` shows that 'a' appears twice (2), 'b' appears once (1), 'c' appears zero times (0), and all other characters from 'd' to 'z' also appear zero times (represented by `... 0`). The arrangement visually demonstrates how the characters in the target string `t` are mapped to their corresponding counts within the `expected_freqs` array, which is used to determine the frequency of each character in the target string.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/sliding-windows/substring-anagrams/image-05-01-2-CI24K7C3.svg)

To set up the sliding window algorithm, let’s define the following components:

- Left and right pointers: Initialize both at the start of the string to define the window's boundaries.
- `window_freqs`: Use an array of size 26 to keep track of the frequencies of characters within the window.
- count: Maintain a variable to count the number of anagrams detected.

Before we slide the window, we first need to expand it to a fixed length of `len_t`. This can be done by advancing the right pointer until the window length is equal to `len_t`. As we expand, ensure to keep `window_freqs` updated to reflect the frequencies of the characters in the window:

Two rectangular boxes labeled 'left' and 'right' are positioned above a light-blue square labeled 'C'. Arrows descend from 'left' and 'right' pointing to 'C', suggesting that 'left' and 'right' might represent boundaries of a sliding window.  To the right of the 'C' square, a sequence of characters 'caabab' is shown.  Adjacent to this character sequence, a variable named 'window_freqs' is defined and assigned a list or array. This array appears to represent the frequency of each character within the window, indicated by the numbers 0, 0, 1, followed by an ellipsis (...) and ending with 0.  Subscripts beneath the numbers in the array 'window_freqs' show that the values correspond to characters 'a', 'b', 'c', ..., 'z', implying that the array tracks the frequency of each character from 'a' to 'z' within the defined window.  The diagram likely depicts a step in a process where the window moves across a larger sequence of characters, updating the 'window_freqs' array at each step.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/sliding-windows/substring-anagrams/image-05-01-3-3HEAIMG3.svg)

Once the window is at the fixed length of `len_t`, we can check if it’s an anagram of t by checking if the `expected_freqs` and `window_freqs` arrays are the same. This can be done in constant time since it requires only 26 comparisons, one for each lowercase English letter.


To slide this window across the string, advance both the left and right pointers one step in each iteration. Ensure to keep `window_freqs` updated by incrementing the frequency of each new character at the right pointer and decrementing the frequency of the character at the left pointer as we move past this left character:

Once we’ve finished processing all substrings of length `len_t`, we can return `count`, which represents the number of anagrams found.


A small optimization we can make is returning 0 if t's length exceeds the length of s because forming an anagram of t from the substrings of s is impossible if t is longer.


## Implementation


In Python, we can use `ord(character) - ord('a')` to find the index of a lowercase English letter in an array of size 26. The ord function takes an integer and returns its ASCII value. This formula calculates the distance of this character from 'a', resulting in an index between 0 and 25.


```python
def substring_anagrams(s: str, t: str) -> int:
    len_s, len_t = len(s), len(t)
    if len_t > len_s:
        return 0
    count = 0
    expected_freqs, window_freqs = [0] * 26, [0] * 26
    # Populate 'expected_freqs' with the characters in string 't'.
    for c in t:
        expected_freqs[ord(c) - ord('a')] += 1
    left = right = 0
    while right < len_s:
        # Add the character at the right pointer to 'window_freqs' before sliding the
        # window.
        window_freqs[ord(s[right]) - ord('a')] += 1
        # If the window has reached the expected fixed length, we advance the left
        # pointer as well as the right pointer to slide the window.
        if right - left + 1 == len_t:
            if window_freqs == expected_freqs:
                count += 1
            # Remove the character at the left pointer from 'window_freqs' before
            # advancing the left pointer.
            window_freqs[ord(s[left]) - ord('a')] -= 1
            left += 1
        right += 1
    return count

### Complexity Analysis


**Time complexity:** The time complexity of `substring_anagrams` is O(n)O(n)O(n), where nnn denotes the length of `s`. Here’s why:

- Populating the `expected_freqs` array takes O(m)O(m)O(m) time, where m denotes the length of t. Since mmm is guaranteed to be less than or equal to nnn at this point, it’s not a dominant term in the time complexity.
- Then, we traverse string `s` linearly with two pointers, which takes O(n)O(n)O(n) time.
- Note that at each iteration, the comparison performed between the two frequency arrays (`expected_freqs` and `window_freqs`) takes O(1)O(1)O(1) time because each array contains only 26 elements.

**Space complexity:** The space complexity is O(1)O(1)O(1) because each frequency array contains only 26 elements.
