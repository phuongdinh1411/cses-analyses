A **uniform** substring is one in which all characters are identical. Given a string, determine the `length` of the longest uniform substring that can be formed by **replacing up to `k` characters**.

Output: 5

```


Explanation: if we can only replace 2 characters, the longest uniform substring we can achieve is "ccccc", obtained by replacing 'b' and 'd' with 'c'.


## Intuition


**Determining if a substring is uniform**

Before we try finding the longest uniform substring, let’s first determine the most efficient way to make a string uniform with the fewest character replacements. Consider the example below:


![Image represents a sequence of lowercase letters arranged horizontally.  The sequence is 'a b a a b a c', where each letter is individually spaced. There are no connections or arrows between the letters; they are simply presented as a linear string of characters. No URLs, parameters, or other information beyond the letters themselves are present in the image.  The letters appear to be a simple example data set, possibly illustrating a concept within the context of coding patterns, such as sequence analysis or pattern recognition.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/sliding-windows/longest-uniform-substring-after-replacements/image-05-03-1-FYEWINUJ.svg)

Which characters should we replace to ensure the minimum number of replacements are performed to make the string uniform? There are three main choices: make the string all ‘a’s, or all ‘b’s, or all ‘c’s. The most efficient choice, requiring the fewest replacements, is to make all characters ‘a’, which involves just three replacements:


![Image represents a transformation process illustrated using sequences of characters.  On the left, we see three subsequences: 'ab', 'aa', and 'ac'.  Each subsequence is individually marked with an orange arrow pointing diagonally upwards and labeled with 'a', indicating that the 'a' element is being processed or removed. A thick black arrow points from the left-hand sequences to the right-hand sequence.  The right-hand side shows a sequence of eight 'a's. The diagram visually depicts a transformation where the input consists of three subsequences containing 'a's and other characters ('b' and 'c'). The transformation removes elements other than 'a' from each subsequence, resulting in an output sequence containing only 'a's, effectively filtering or extracting 'a's from the input.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/sliding-windows/longest-uniform-substring-after-replacements/image-05-03-2-YYDIUJ65.svg)

The key observation is that the minimum number of replacements needed to achieve uniformity is obtained by **replacing all characters except the most frequent one**.


This suggests that if we know the highest frequency of a character in a substring, we can determine if our value of k is sufficient to make that substring uniform. The number of characters that need to be replaced (num_chars_to_replace) can be found by subtracting this highest frequency from the total number of characters in the substring:


![Image represents a calculation to determine the number of characters to replace in a substring.  At the top, a sequence of characters 'a b a a b a c' is shown, with the character 'b' and 'c' crossed out in orange, indicating they are to be replaced. Below this, a grey box contains a calculation: `num_chars_to_replace = len(substring) - highest_freq`. This equation calculates the number of characters to replace by subtracting the highest frequency of any single character (`highest_freq`) from the total length of the substring (`len(substring)`).  The calculation is then shown step-by-step:  `len(substring)` is explicitly given as 7, `highest_freq` as 4, resulting in a final answer of 3 characters to replace (`num_chars_to_replace = 3`).  The variables `num_chars_to_replace`, `len(substring)`, and `highest_freq` are written in orange, black, and blue respectively, highlighting their roles in the calculation.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/sliding-windows/longest-uniform-substring-after-replacements/image-05-03-3-3PEN6ETI.svg)

Once we’ve calculated num_chars_to_replace for a given substring, we can assess if the substring can be made uniform:

- If `num_chars_to_replace ≤ k`, the substring can be made uniform.
- If `num_chars_to_replace > k`, the substring cannot be made uniform.

To calculate num_chars_to_replace, we need to know the value of `highest_freq`. This requires tracking the frequency of each character, which can be efficiently managed using a **hash map** (`freqs`). This hash map allows us to update `highest_freq` whenever we encounter a character with a higher frequency. Below is an illustration of how `freqs` is updated:


![Image represents a data flow diagram illustrating the process of finding the highest frequency of a character in a sequence.  The input, shown as 'a b c' with a downward arrow indicating data flow, represents a sequence of characters. This input feeds into a table labeled 'freqs', which is a two-column table with headers 'char' and 'freq'.  The table shows the character 'a' and its frequency '1'.  This table acts as an intermediate data structure storing character frequencies.  A separate box contains a code snippet: `highest_freq = max(highest_freq, freqs['a'])`, which calculates the highest frequency encountered so far.  The variable `highest_freq` is updated using the `max` function, comparing its current value with the frequency of character 'a' (obtained from the `freqs` table using the key 'a'). The result of this calculation, '1', is displayed below the equation, indicating that the highest frequency found so far is 1.  The overall diagram shows how the input sequence is processed to determine the highest character frequency.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/sliding-windows/longest-uniform-substring-after-replacements/image-05-03-4-THMG57YT.svg)

Now that we have the tools to determine if a substring can be made uniform, the next step is to figure out how to identify the longest uniform substring. Let’s explore a technique that lets us do this.


**Dynamic sliding window**

We know sliding windows can be useful for solving problems involving substrings. This problem requires that we find the longest substring that satisfies a specific condition:


> num_chars_to_replace <= k


So, a dynamic sliding window might be appropriate, as discussed in the chapter introduction.


We can use the above condition to determine how to expand or shrink the window:

- If the condition is met (i.e., the window is valid), we **expand** the window to find a longer window that still meets this condition.
- If the condition is violated (i.e., the window is invalid), we **shrink** the window until it meets the condition again.

Let’s see how this works over the example below:


![Image represents a sequence of characters 'a a b c d c c a' followed by a comma and then an equation 'k = 2'.  The sequence of characters appears to be a data set or input, possibly representing a string or an array of elements.  The characters 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd' are individual elements within this sequence, arranged linearly from left to right.  There's no explicit connection shown between the character sequence and the equation 'k = 2', but the proximity suggests a relationship, possibly indicating that 'k' is a parameter or variable related to the processing or analysis of the character sequence.  The value '2' assigned to 'k' might represent a length, a count, or some other relevant property of the sequence.  The comma acts as a separator between the character sequence and the equation.](https://bytebytego.com/images/courses/coding-patterns/sliding-windows/longest-uniform-substring-after-replacements/image-05-03-8-PULTVZMZ.svg)

Start by defining the left and right boundaries of the window at index 0. Continue expanding the window for as long as it satisfies our condition (`nums_char_to_replace <= k`):

Once the window expands to the fifth character (‘d’), it will contain 3 characters that must be replaced to make the window uniform. Since we can only replace up to k = 2 characters, the window is invalid. So, we shrink the window:

Above this sequence, two rectangular boxes labeled 'left' (in orange) and 'right' (in gray) indicate the direction of data input.  A downward-pointing arrow from 'left' connects to the first 'a' in the sequence, with a dashed arrow indicating an additional 'a' to the left of the main sequence. A downward-pointing arrow from 'right' connects to the last 'd' in the sequence. Below the central sequence, red upward-pointing arrows connect to each character (b, c, and d) with the text 'chars to replace' indicating these characters are targets for modification. To the right, a dashed-line rectangle displays the text 'highest_freq = 2 X', suggesting that the character with the highest frequency (presumably 'a' or 'c' based on the visible data) has a frequency of 2, and the 'X' likely represents a placeholder or an operation to be performed based on this frequency.

Notice that after shrinking the window, the value of `highest_freq` is still 2, which is no longer correct. Recall that our current method for updating `highest_freq` only increases it when encountering a character with a higher frequency, meaning `highest_freq` can only remain the same or increase, but it can never decrease.


One way to work around this is to develop a new method for updating `highest_freq` that accurately decreases it when the highest frequency in a window decreases. However, our goal is to find the longest substring that meets the condition, so shrinking the window might not even be necessary. The crucial point here is that **when we find a valid window of a certain length, no shorter window will provide a longer uniform substring**.


> This means we can just slide the window instead of shrinking it whenever we encounter an invalid window, effectively maintaining the length of the current window.


With this observation, we should correct our previous logic:

- If the window satisfies the condition: expand.
- **If the window doesn’t satisfy the condition: slide**.

Let’s correct the action taken in the first invalid window above by sliding instead of shrinking. Then, we can continue processing the rest of the string.

The above window is the final window because we cannot expand or slide it any further. The longest valid window encountered during this process is a window of length 5.


## Implementation


```python
def longest_uniform_substring_after_replacements(s: str, k: int) -> int:
    freqs = {}
    highest_freq = max_len = 0
    left = right = 0
    while right < len(s):
        # Update the frequency of the character at the right pointer and the highest
        # frequency for the current window.
        freqs[s[right]] = freqs.get(s[right], 0) + 1
        highest_freq = max(highest_freq, freqs[s[right]])
        # Calculate replacements needed for the current window.
        num_chars_to_replace = (right - left + 1) - highest_freq
        # Slide the window if the number of replacements needed exceeds 'k'.
        # The right pointer always gets advanced, so we just need to advance 'left'.
        if num_chars_to_replace > k:
            # Remove the character at the left pointer from the hash map before
            # advancing the left pointer.
            freqs[s[left]] -= 1
            left += 1
        # Since the length of the current window increases or stays the same, assign
        # the length of the current window to 'max_len'.
