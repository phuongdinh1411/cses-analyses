# About This Project

## 🎯 Mission

This project aims to provide comprehensive, well-explained solutions to CSES (Code Submission Evaluation System) problems. Our goal is to help competitive programmers understand not just *how* to solve problems, but *why* certain approaches work and how to think about algorithmic problem-solving.

## 📚 What You'll Find Here

### Comprehensive Problem Analysis
Each problem includes:
- **Problem Statement**: Clear understanding of what needs to be solved
- **Solution Progression**: Step-by-step improvement from naive to optimal solutions
- **Complexity Analysis**: Time and space complexity explanations
- **Key Insights**: Fundamental concepts and principles
- **Notable Techniques**: Important algorithms and data structures
- **Problem-Solving Framework**: Systematic approach to similar problems

### Problem Variations
Every problem includes 5 variations:
1. **Cost-based**: Adding cost constraints to problems
2. **Constraint-based**: Adding budget or resource limitations
3. **Probabilistic**: Adding probability and uncertainty
4. **Multi-criteria**: Optimizing for multiple objectives
5. **Dynamic**: Handling dynamic updates and changes

### Related Concepts
Each problem connects to:
- **Related Problems**: Similar problems and techniques
- **Competitive Programming Variations**: Contest-specific optimizations
- **Mathematical Extensions**: Theoretical foundations
- **Learning Resources**: Further reading and practice
