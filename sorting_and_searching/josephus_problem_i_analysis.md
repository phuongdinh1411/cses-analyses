# CSES Josephus Problem I - Problem Analysis

## Problem Statement
There are n people numbered from 1 to n standing in a circle. Starting from person 1, we eliminate every second person until only one person remains. Find the position of the last remaining person.

### Input
The first input line has an integer n: the number of people.

### Output
Print one integer: the position of the last remaining person.

### Constraints
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9

### Example
```
Input:
7

Output:
7
```

## Solution Progression

### Approach 1: Simulation - O(n)
**Description**: Simulate the elimination process step by step.

```python
def josephus_problem_i_naive(n):
    people = list(range(1, n + 1))
    index = 0
    
    while len(people) > 1:
        # Eliminate every second person
        index = (index + 1) % len(people)
        people.pop(index)
    
    return people[0]
```

**Why this is inefficient**: We need to eliminate n-1 people, and each elimination takes O(n) time, leading to O(n²) time complexity.

### Improvement 1: Mathematical Formula - O(log n)
**Description**: Use the mathematical formula for the Josephus problem.

```python
def josephus_problem_i_optimized(n):
    # Find the largest power of 2 less than or equal to n
    l = 1
    while l * 2 <= n:
        l *= 2
    
    # The answer is 2 * (n - l) + 1
    return 2 * (n - l) + 1
```

**Why this improvement works**: The Josephus problem has a closed-form solution. If n = 2^m + l where 0 ≤ l < 2^m, then the last remaining person is at position 2*l + 1.

## Final Optimal Solution

```python
n = int(input())

def find_last_remaining_person(n):
    # Find the largest power of 2 less than or equal to n
    l = 1
    while l * 2 <= n:
        l *= 2
    
    # The answer is 2 * (n - l) + 1
    return 2 * (n - l) + 1

result = find_last_remaining_person(n)
print(result)
```

        highest_bit += 1
    
    # Calculate l (remaining part)
