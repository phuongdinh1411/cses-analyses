# CSES Collecting Numbers II - Problem Analysis

## Problem Statement
Given an array of n integers, you want to collect them in increasing order. You can collect a number if you have already collected all numbers smaller than it. Find the minimum number of rounds needed to collect all numbers.

### Input
The first input line has an integer n: the size of the array.
The second line has n integers x1,x2,…,xn: the array.

### Output
Print one integer: the minimum number of rounds.

### Constraints
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5
- 1 ≤ xi ≤ n

### Example
```
Input:
5
4 2 1 5 3

Output:
2
```

## Solution Progression

### Approach 1: Simulate Collection Process - O(n²)
**Description**: Simulate the collection process by finding the longest increasing subsequence.

```python
def collecting_numbers_ii_naive(n, arr):
    # Create a list of (value, index) pairs
    pairs = [(arr[i], i) for i in range(n)]
    pairs.sort()  # Sort by value
    
    rounds = 0
    collected = set()
    
    while len(collected) < n:
        rounds += 1
        current_round = []
        
        for value, index in pairs:
            if index not in collected:
                # Check if we can collect this number
                can_collect = True
                for smaller_value, smaller_index in pairs:
                    if smaller_value < value and smaller_index not in collected:
                        can_collect = False
                        break
                
                if can_collect:
                    current_round.append(index)
                    collected.add(index)
        
        if not current_round:
            break
    
    return rounds
```

**Why this is inefficient**: For each round, we need to check all remaining numbers, leading to O(n²) time complexity.

### Improvement 1: Position Tracking - O(n log n)
**Description**: Track positions of numbers and find the minimum rounds using position analysis.

```python
def collecting_numbers_ii_optimized(n, arr):
    # Create position array: pos[i] = position of number i in the array
    pos = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        pos[arr[i]] = i
    
    rounds = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        # If current number comes before the previous number in the array,
        # we need an additional round
        if pos[i] < pos[i - 1]:
            rounds += 1
    
    return rounds
```

**Why this improvement works**: We only need to check if consecutive numbers in sorted order appear in the correct order in the original array.

## Final Optimal Solution

```python
n = int(input())
arr = list(map(int, input().split()))

def find_minimum_rounds(n, arr):
    # Create position array: pos[i] = position of number i in the array
    pos = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        pos[arr[i]] = i
    
    rounds = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        # If current number comes before the previous number in the array,
        # we need an additional round
        if pos[i] < pos[i - 1]:
            rounds += 1
    
    return rounds

result = find_minimum_rounds(n, arr)
print(result)
```

    rounds = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        if pos[i] < pos[i - 1]:
            rounds += 1
    return rounds

### 3. **Order Analysis**
```python
def analyze_order(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    pos = build_position_array(n, arr)
    
    inversions = 0
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        if pos[i] < pos[i - 1]:
            inversions += 1
    
    return inversions + 1
```

## Problem-Solving Framework

1. **Identify problem type**: This is a collection order problem
2. **Choose approach**: Use position tracking for efficient analysis
3. **Build position array**: Map values to their positions in the array
4. **Count rounds**: Count inversions in the position array
5. **Return result**: Output the minimum number of rounds
