# Long-Running Agent Progress Log
# Project: CSES Analyses - System Design Content Improvement
# Created: 2026-02-04

## Project Goal
Transform system design documents from solution-oriented to interview-style discussion format:
1. Remove implementation code sections
2. Add trade-off discussions for every technical decision
3. Follow interview process flow (discuss before drawing)

## Session History

### Session 1 - 2026-02-04 - Initialization
- Explored system_design/ folder structure (10 files, ~429KB total)
- Analyzed current document patterns and identified issues
- Found design-key-value-store.md as best template (has interview-style callouts)
- Identified implementation code to remove:
  - design-url-shortener.md: ~350 lines
  - design-chat-system.md: ~500 lines
  - design-web-crawler.md: ~700+ lines
  - design-news-feed.md: ~200 lines
  - design-payment-system.md: ~200 lines
  - design-unique-id-generator.md: ~200 lines
  - consistent-hashing.md: ~80 lines
- Created feature list with 13 features
- Created LRA scaffolding

### Session 2 - 2026-02-04 - Template Creation
- Analyzed design-key-value-store.md to extract interview-style patterns
- Created .lra/interview-style-template.md with:
  - Core principles (Problem before solution, Discussion over presentation)
  - Required sections format (Interview context, The Challenge, Options, Why not X?)
  - Document structure template
  - What to remove (implementation code, language-specific details)
  - Acceptable pseudocode guidelines
  - Checklist for document completion
- Completed F001
