# CSES Planets Queries II - Problem Analysis

## Problem Statement
Given a directed graph with n planets and q queries, for each query find the first planet that appears in both paths starting from planets a and b.

### Input
The first input line has two integers n and q: the number of planets and queries.
The second line has n integers t1,t2,…,tn: for each planet, there is a teleporter from planet i to planet ti.
Then there are q lines describing the queries. Each line has two integers a and b: find the first common planet in paths from a and b.

### Output
For each query, print the first common planet, or -1 if there is no common planet.

### Constraints
- 1 ≤ n,q ≤ 2⋅10^5
- 1 ≤ ti ≤ n
- 1 ≤ a,b ≤ n

### Example
```
Input:
5 3
2 3 4 5 3
1 2
1 3
2 4

Output:
3
3
-1
```

## Solution Progression

### Approach 1: Naive Path Comparison - O(q * n)
**Description**: Generate paths and find first common element.

```python
def planets_queries_ii_naive(n, q, teleporters, queries):
    def get_path(start):
        path = []
        current = start
        visited = set()
        
        while current not in visited:
            path.append(current)
            visited.add(current)
            current = teleporters[current - 1]
        
        return path
    
    results = []
    for a, b in queries:
        path_a = get_path(a)
        path_b = get_path(b)
        
        # Find first common element
        common = -1
        for planet in path_a:
            if planet in path_b:
                common = planet
                break
        
        results.append(common)
    
    return results
```

**Why this is inefficient**: We generate full paths for each query, leading to quadratic complexity.

### Improvement 1: Cycle Detection with Binary Lifting - O(n log n + q log n)
**Description**: Use binary lifting to find cycle entry points and compare efficiently.

```python
def planets_queries_ii_optimized(n, q, teleporters, queries):
    # Build binary lifting table
    log_n = 20
    up = [[0] * n for _ in range(log_n)]
    
    # Initialize first row
    for i in range(n):
        up[0][i] = teleporters[i] - 1
    
    # Build binary lifting table
    for j in range(1, log_n):
        for i in range(n):
            up[j][i] = up[j-1][up[j-1][i]]
    
    # Find cycle entry points using Floyd's cycle finding
    def find_cycle_entry(start):
        # Floyd's cycle finding
        slow = fast = start - 1
        while True:
            slow = teleporters[slow] - 1
            fast = teleporters[teleporters[fast] - 1] - 1
            if slow == fast:
                break
        
        # Find cycle entry
        slow = start - 1
        while slow != fast:
            slow = teleporters[slow] - 1
            fast = teleporters[fast] - 1
        
        return slow + 1
    
    # Precompute cycle entries
    cycle_entries = [find_cycle_entry(i) for i in range(1, n + 1)]
    
    # Answer queries
    results = []
    for a, b in queries:
        # Check if paths meet before entering cycles
        path_a = []
        path_b = []
        
        current_a = a
        current_b = b
        
        # Generate paths until cycle entry
        while current_a != cycle_entries[a - 1]:
            path_a.append(current_a)
            current_a = teleporters[current_a - 1]
        path_a.append(current_a)
        
        while current_b != cycle_entries[b - 1]:
            path_b.append(current_b)
            current_b = teleporters[current_b - 1]
        path_b.append(current_b)
        
        # Find first common element
        common = -1
        for planet in path_a:
            if planet in path_b:
                common = planet
                break
        
        results.append(common)
    
    return results
```

**Why this improvement works**: We use Floyd's cycle finding to detect cycles and then compare paths efficiently.

            fast = teleporters[fast] - 1
        
        return slow + 1
    
    # Precompute cycle entries
    cycle_entries = [find_cycle_entry(i) for i in range(1, n + 1)]
    
    # Answer queries

        current_a = a
        current_b = b
        
        # Generate paths until cycle entry
        while current_a != cycle_entries[a - 1]:
            path_a.append(current_a)
            current_a = teleporters[current_a - 1]
        path_a.append(current_a)
        
        while current_b != cycle_entries[b - 1]:
            path_b.append(current_b)
            current_b = teleporters[current_b - 1]
        path_b.append(current_b)
        
        # Find first common element
        common = -1
        for planet in path_a:
            if planet in path_b:
                common = planet
                break
        
        results.append(common)
    
    return results

# Read queries
queries = []
for _ in range(q):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    queries.append((a, b))

result = answer_planets_queries_ii(n, q, teleporters, queries)
for res in result:
    print(res)
```
