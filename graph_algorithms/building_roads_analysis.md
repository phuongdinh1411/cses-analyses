## Problem Statement
There are n cities and m roads between them. Your task is to determine the minimum number of new roads that need to be built so that there is a route between any two cities.

### Input

Then, there are m lines describing the roads. Each line has two integers a and b: there is a road between cities a and b.

### Output
Print one integer: the minimum number of new roads.

### Constraints

- 1 ≤ m ≤ 2⋅10^5

### Example

Input:
4 2
1 2
3 4

Output:
1
```

## Solution Progression

### Approach 1: DFS to Count Components - O(n + m)
**Description**: Use depth-first search to find connected components and count the minimum roads needed.

```python
def building_roads_dfs(n, m, roads):
    # Build adjacency list
    graph = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for a, b in roads:
        graph[a].append(b)
        graph[b].append(a)
    
    def dfs(node):
        if visited[node]:
            return
        visited[node] = True
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            dfs(neighbor)
    
    visited = [False] * (n + 1)
    components = 0
    
    # Count connected components
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if not visited[i]:
            dfs(i)
            components += 1
    
    # Minimum roads needed = components - 1
    return components - 1
```

**Why this is efficient**: We visit each node and edge at most once, giving us O(n + m) complexity.

### Improvement 1: BFS for Component Counting - O(n + m)
**Description**: Use breadth-first search instead of DFS for component counting.

```python
from collections import deque

def building_roads_bfs(n, m, roads):
    # Build adjacency list
    graph = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for a, b in roads:
        graph[a].append(b)
        graph[b].append(a)
    
    def bfs(start):
        queue = deque([start])
        visited[start] = True
        
        while queue:
            node = queue.popleft()
            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                if not visited[neighbor]:
                    visited[neighbor] = True
                    queue.append(neighbor)
    
    visited = [False] * (n + 1)
    components = 0
    
    # Count connected components
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if not visited[i]:
            bfs(i)
            components += 1
    
    # Minimum roads needed = components - 1
    return components - 1
```

**Why this improvement works**: BFS can be more memory-efficient for very large components and avoids potential stack overflow.

### Improvement 2: Union-Find (Disjoint Set) - O(n + m * α(n))
**Description**: Use union-find data structure to efficiently track connected components.

```python
class UnionFind:
    def __init__(self, n):
        self.parent = list(range(n + 1))
        self.rank = [0] * (n + 1)
    
    def find(self, x):
        if self.parent[x] != x:
            self.parent[x] = self.find(self.parent[x])
        return self.parent[x]
    
    def union(self, x, y):
        px, py = self.find(x), self.find(y)
        if px == py:
            return
        if self.rank[px] < self.rank[py]:
            px, py = py, px
        self.parent[py] = px
        if self.rank[px] == self.rank[py]:
            self.rank[px] += 1

def building_roads_union_find(n, m, roads):
    uf = UnionFind(n)
    
    # Union all connected cities
    for a, b in roads:
        uf.union(a, b)
    
    # Count unique components
    components = set()
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        components.add(uf.find(i))
    
    # Minimum roads needed = components - 1
    return len(components) - 1
```

**Why this improvement works**: Union-find is very efficient for connectivity queries and can handle dynamic connectivity changes.

### Alternative: Iterative DFS with Stack - O(n + m)
**Description**: Use iterative DFS to avoid recursion stack overflow.

```python
def building_roads_iterative_dfs(n, m, roads):
    # Build adjacency list
    graph = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for a, b in roads:
        graph[a].append(b)
        graph[b].append(a)
    
    def dfs_iterative(start):
        stack = [start]
        visited[start] = True
        
        while stack:
            node = stack.pop()
            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                if not visited[neighbor]:
                    visited[neighbor] = True
                    stack.append(neighbor)
    
    visited = [False] * (n + 1)
    components = 0
    
    # Count connected components
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if not visited[i]:
            dfs_iterative(i)
            components += 1
    
    # Minimum roads needed = components - 1
    return components - 1
```

**Why this works**: Iterative DFS avoids potential stack overflow for very large graphs while maintaining the same logic as recursive DFS.

## Final Optimal Solution

```python
n, m = map(int, input().split())
roads = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(m)]

# Build adjacency list
graph = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
for a, b in roads:
    graph[a].append(b)
    graph[b].append(a)

def dfs(node):
    if visited[node]:
        return
    visited[node] = True
    for neighbor in graph[node]:
        dfs(neighbor)

visited = [False] * (n + 1)
components = 0

# Count connected components
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    if not visited[i]:
        dfs(i)
        components += 1

# Minimum roads needed = components - 1
print(components - 1)
```

```

### 2. **Union-Find Pattern**

    def find(self, x):
        if self.parent[x] != x:
            self.parent[x] = self.find(self.parent[x])
        return self.parent[x]
    
    def union(self, x, y):
