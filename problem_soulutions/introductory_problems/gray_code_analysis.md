## Problem Description

**Problem**: Generate a Gray code sequence of length 2‚Åø where consecutive numbers differ by exactly one bit.

**Input**: An integer n (1 ‚â§ n ‚â§ 16)

**Output**: Print the Gray code sequence.

**Constraints**:
- 1 ‚â§ n ‚â§ 16
- Generate sequence of length 2‚Åø
- Consecutive numbers must differ by exactly one bit
- Sequence must contain all possible n-bit numbers
- Output each number on a separate line

**Example**:
```

Explanation: Binary representation shows consecutive numbers differ by one bit:

```

## Visual Example

### Input and Gray Code Properties
```
Input: n = 2

Gray Code Properties:
- Length: 2‚Åø = 2¬≤ = 4 numbers
- Consecutive numbers differ by exactly one bit
- Contains all possible 2-bit numbers
- Binary representation: 00, 01, 10, 11
```

### Gray Code Sequence Generation
```
For n = 2, Gray code sequence:

Index  Binary  Gray Code  Decimal
0      00      00         0
1      01      01         1
2      10      11         3
3      11      10         2

Sequence: 0 ‚Üí 1 ‚Üí 3 ‚Üí 2
```

### Bit Difference Verification
```
Consecutive pairs and bit differences:

0 (00) ‚Üí 1 (01): Only bit 0 changes
1 (01) ‚Üí 3 (11): Only bit 1 changes  
3 (11) ‚Üí 2 (10): Only bit 0 changes

Each consecutive pair differs by exactly one bit ‚úì
```

### Mathematical Formula Application
```
Using formula: gray = i ^ (i >> 1)

i=0: 00 ^ (00 >> 1) = 00 ^ 00 = 00 = 0
i=1: 01 ^ (01 >> 1) = 01 ^ 00 = 01 = 1
i=2: 10 ^ (10 >> 1) = 10 ^ 01 = 11 = 3
i=3: 11 ^ (11 >> 1) = 11 ^ 01 = 10 = 2
```

### Key Insight
The solution works by:
1. Using the mathematical formula i ^ (i >> 1) to convert binary to Gray code
2. Generating all 2‚Åø numbers in sequence
3. Ensuring consecutive numbers differ by exactly one bit
4. Time complexity: O(2‚Åø) for generating the sequence
5. Space complexity: O(1) for generating without storage

## üîç Solution Analysis: From Brute Force to Optimal

### Approach 1: Naive Recursive Construction (Inefficient)

**Key Insights from Naive Recursive Solution:**
- Use recursive construction with reflection and leading bit addition
- Simple but has overhead from recursion and copying
- Not suitable for large n due to memory usage
- Straightforward implementation but poor scalability

**Algorithm:**
1. Start with base case (n=0) returning [0]
2. For each step, get previous Gray code sequence
3. Reflect the sequence and add leading 1
4. Combine original and reflected sequences

**Visual Example:**
```
Naive recursive construction: Build by reflection
For n = 2:

n=0: [0]
n=1: [0] + [1] = [0, 1]
n=2: [0, 1] + [3, 2] = [0, 1, 3, 2]

Reflection process:
[0, 1] ‚Üí reverse ‚Üí [1, 0] ‚Üí add leading 1 ‚Üí [3, 2]
```

**Implementation:**
```python
def gray_code_recursive(n):
    if n == 0:
        return [0]
    
    # Get Gray code for n-1 bits
    prev = gray_code_recursive(n - 1)
    result = prev.copy()
    
    # Add reflected sequence with leading 1
    for i in range(len(prev) - 1, -1, -1):
        result.append(prev[i] | (1 << (n - 1)))
    
    return result

def solve_gray_code_recursive():
    n = int(input())
    sequence = gray_code_recursive(n)
    for num in sequence:
        print(num)
```

**Time Complexity:** O(2‚Åø) for generating the sequence
**Space Complexity:** O(2‚Åø) for storing the sequence and recursion stack

**Why it's inefficient:**
- O(2‚Åø) space complexity for storing sequence
- Recursion overhead for large n
- Memory-intensive for large sequences
- Poor performance with exponential growth

### Approach 2: Iterative Construction (Better)

**Key Insights from Iterative Construction Solution:**
- Use iterative approach to build Gray code sequence
- More memory-efficient than recursive approach
- Standard method for Gray code generation
- Can handle larger n than recursive approach

**Algorithm:**
1. Start with [0] for n=0
2. For each bit position, reflect current sequence
3. Add leading 1 to reflected part
4. Combine sequences iteratively

**Visual Example:**
```
Iterative construction: Build step by step
For n = 2:

Step 0: [0]
Step 1: [0] + [1] = [0, 1]
Step 2: [0, 1] + [3, 2] = [0, 1, 3, 2]

Each step doubles the sequence length
```

**Implementation:**
```python
def gray_code_iterative(n):
    result = [0]
    
    for i in range(n):
        # Reflect and add leading 1
        size = len(result)
        for j in range(size - 1, -1, -1):
            result.append(result[j] | (1 << i))
    
    return result

def solve_gray_code_iterative():
    n = int(input())
    sequence = gray_code_iterative(n)
    for num in sequence:
        print(num)
```

**Time Complexity:** O(2‚Åø) for generating the sequence
**Space Complexity:** O(2‚Åø) for storing the sequence

**Why it's better:**
- No recursion overhead
- More memory-efficient than recursive approach
- Suitable for competitive programming
- Efficient for most practical cases

### Approach 3: Mathematical Formula (Optimal)

**Key Insights from Mathematical Formula Solution:**
- Use the proven formula i ^ (i >> 1) to generate Gray code
- Most efficient approach for Gray code generation
- Standard method in competitive programming
- Can handle the maximum constraint efficiently

**Algorithm:**
1. Use the mathematical formula gray = i ^ (i >> 1)
2. Generate numbers from 0 to 2‚Åø - 1
3. Apply formula to each number
4. Print results directly without storage

**Visual Example:**
```
Mathematical formula: i ^ (i >> 1)
For n = 2:

i=0: 00 ^ (00 >> 1) = 00 ^ 00 = 00 = 0
i=1: 01 ^ (01 >> 1) = 01 ^ 00 = 01 = 1
i=2: 10 ^ (10 >> 1) = 10 ^ 01 = 11 = 3
i=3: 11 ^ (11 >> 1) = 11 ^ 01 = 10 = 2

Result: 0, 1, 3, 2
```

**Implementation:**
```python
def solve_gray_code():
    n = int(input())
    
    # Generate Gray code using formula
    for i in range(1 << n):
        gray = i ^ (i >> 1)
        print(gray)

# Main execution
if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve_gray_code()
```

**Time Complexity:** O(2‚Åø) for generating the sequence
**Space Complexity:** O(1) for generating without storage

**Why it's optimal:**
- O(1) space complexity is optimal for this problem
- Uses mathematical formula for efficient generation
- Most efficient approach for competitive programming
- Standard method for Gray code generation
