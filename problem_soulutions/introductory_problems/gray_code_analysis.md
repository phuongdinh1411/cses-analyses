# Gray Code Analysis

## Problem Description

Generate a Gray code sequence of length 2^n where consecutive numbers differ by exactly one bit.

## Key Insights

### 1. Gray Code Properties
- **Definition**: A Gray code is a binary numeral system where two consecutive values differ by only one bit
- **Length**: Always 2^n for n-bit numbers
- **Construction**: Can be built recursively or iteratively

### 2. Recursive Construction
- For n=1: [0, 1]
- For n=2: [00, 01, 11, 10]
- For n=3: [000, 001, 011, 010, 110, 111, 101, 100]

### 3. Mathematical Formula
- Gray code for number i: `i ^ (i >> 1)`
- This flips the bit that needs to change

## Solution Approach

### Method 1: Recursive Construction
```python
def gray_code(n):
    if n == 0:
        return [0]
    
    prev = gray_code(n - 1)
    result = prev.copy()
    
    # Add reflected sequence with leading 1
    for i in range(len(prev) - 1, -1, -1):
        result.append(prev[i] | (1 << (n - 1)))
    
    return result
```

### Method 2: Iterative Formula
```python
def gray_code(n):
    result = []
    size = 1 << n
    
    for i in range(size):
        result.append(i ^ (i >> 1))
    
    return result
```

### Method 3: Bit Manipulation
```python
def gray_code(n):
    result = [0] * (1 << n)
    
    for i in range(1 << n):
        result[i] = i ^ (i >> 1)
    
    return result
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time**: O(2^n) - we generate 2^n numbers
- **Space**: O(2^n) - to store the result

## Example Walkthrough

**Input**: n = 3

**Process**:
1. Start with n=1: [0, 1]
2. Reflect and add leading 1: [00, 01, 11, 10]
3. Reflect and add leading 1: [000, 001, 011, 010, 110, 111, 101, 100]

**Output**: [0, 1, 3, 2, 6, 7, 5, 4]

## Problem Variations

### Variation 1: Circular Gray Code
**Problem**: Generate Gray code where first and last numbers also differ by one bit.

**Solution**: Use reflected Gray code which is naturally circular.

### Variation 2: Weighted Gray Code
**Problem**: Each bit has a weight. Find Gray code with minimum total weight.

**Approach**: Use dynamic programming or greedy approach.

### Variation 3: K-ary Gray Code
**Problem**: Generate Gray code for base-k numbers (not just binary).

**Solution**: Generalize the reflection method for k-ary numbers.

### Variation 4: Balanced Gray Code
**Problem**: Generate Gray code where each bit changes equal number of times.

**Approach**: Use balanced Gray code construction algorithms.

### Variation 5: Minimum Distance Gray Code
**Problem**: Find Gray code with maximum minimum Hamming distance between any two numbers.

**Approach**: Use error-correcting code techniques.

## Advanced Applications

### 1. Digital Electronics
- Used in rotary encoders
- Prevents glitches during transitions
- Applied in analog-to-digital converters

### 2. Error Detection
- Single-bit errors are easily detectable
- Used in communication protocols
- Applied in memory systems

### 3. Combinatorial Optimization
- Used in traveling salesman problem
- Applied in circuit design
- Used in genetic algorithms

## Implementation Details

### Efficient Bit Operations
```python
# Check if two numbers differ by exactly one bit
def differ_by_one_bit(a, b):
    diff = a ^ b
    return diff != 0 and (diff & (diff - 1)) == 0

# Get the position of the differing bit
def get_differing_bit(a, b):
    return (a ^ b).bit_length() - 1
```

### Memory-Efficient Generation
```python
def generate_gray_code(n):
    result = []
    result.reserve(1 << n)  # Pre-allocate space
    
    for i in range(1 << n):
        result.append(i ^ (i >> 1))
    
    return result
```
