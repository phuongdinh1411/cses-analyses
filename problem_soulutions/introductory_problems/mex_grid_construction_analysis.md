# Mex Grid Construction

## 📋 Problem Information

### 🎯 **Learning Objectives**
By the end of this problem, you should be able to:
- Understand MEX (minimum excluded value) concepts and grid construction problems
- Apply constraint satisfaction and mathematical analysis to construct valid grids
- Implement efficient grid construction algorithms with proper MEX validation
- Optimize grid construction using mathematical analysis and constraint satisfaction
- Handle edge cases in grid construction (impossible constraints, large grids, MEX validation)
