## Problem Description

**Problem**: Given a string, find the lexicographically smallest string that can be obtained by reordering its characters.

**Input**: A string s (1 ‚â§ |s| ‚â§ 10‚Å∂)

**Output**: The lexicographically smallest string that can be obtained by reordering the characters of s.

**Constraints**:
- 1 ‚â§ |s| ‚â§ 10‚Å∂
- String contains only uppercase letters A-Z
- Find lexicographically smallest arrangement
- Handle duplicate characters correctly
- Preserve all original characters

**Example**:
```
Input: "CAB"

Output: "ABC"

Explanation: By reordering the characters, we can get "ABC", "ACB", "BAC", "BCA", "CAB", "CBA". 
The lexicographically smallest is "ABC".
```

## Visual Example

### Input and Character Analysis
```
Input: s = "CAB"

Character frequency:
A: 1 occurrence
B: 1 occurrence
C: 1 occurrence

ASCII values:
A = 65, B = 66, C = 67

Lexicographic order: A < B < C
```

### Lexicographic Ordering Process
```
For string "CAB":

All possible arrangements:
1. ABC ‚Üê lexicographically smallest
2. ACB
3. BAC
4. BCA
5. CAB (original)
6. CBA

Lexicographic comparison:
- Compare characters from left to right
- First differing character determines order
- A < B < C in ASCII order
```

### Character Frequency Construction
```
Frequency counting approach:
For "CAB":

Step 1: Count frequencies
freq[A] = 1, freq[B] = 1, freq[C] = 1

Step 2: Construct result
result = ""
for i in range(26):
    result += chr(ord('A') + i) * freq[i]

Result: "A" + "B" + "C" = "ABC"
```

### Key Insight
The solution works by:
1. Counting frequency of each character
2. Constructing result by placing characters in lexicographic order
3. Repeating each character according to its frequency
4. Time complexity: O(n) for counting and construction
5. Space complexity: O(1) for frequency array

## üîç Solution Analysis: From Brute Force to Optimal

### Approach 1: Generate All Permutations (Inefficient)

**Key Insights from Permutation Generation Solution:**
- Generate all possible character arrangements
- Find the lexicographically smallest among all permutations
- Simple but computationally expensive approach
- Not suitable for large strings due to factorial growth

**Algorithm:**
1. Generate all possible permutations of the string
2. Find the lexicographically smallest permutation
3. Return the result

**Visual Example:**
```
Permutation generation: Generate all arrangements
For string "CAB":

All permutations:
ABC, ACB, BAC, BCA, CAB, CBA

Find minimum: "ABC"
```

**Implementation:**
```python
from itertools import permutations

def string_reorder_permutations(s):
    # Generate all permutations
    perms = [''.join(p) for p in permutations(s)]
    
    # Find lexicographically smallest
    return min(perms)

def solve_string_reorder_permutations():
    s = input().strip()
    result = string_reorder_permutations(s)
    print(result)
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n! √ó n) for generating all permutations
**Space Complexity:** O(n! √ó n) for storing all permutations

**Why it's inefficient:**
- O(n! √ó n) time complexity grows factorially
- Not suitable for competitive programming with n up to 10‚Å∂
- Memory-intensive for large strings
- Poor performance with exponential growth

### Approach 2: Simple Sorting (Better)

**Key Insights from Sorting Solution:**
- Sort characters directly to get lexicographically smallest arrangement
- More efficient than permutation generation
- Standard method for lexicographic ordering
- Can handle large strings efficiently

**Algorithm:**
1. Convert string to list of characters
2. Sort the characters in ascending order
3. Join back to form the result string

**Visual Example:**
```
Simple sorting: Sort characters directly
For string "CAB":

Step 1: Convert to list ‚Üí ['C', 'A', 'B']
Step 2: Sort ‚Üí ['A', 'B', 'C']
Step 3: Join ‚Üí "ABC"
```

**Implementation:**
```python
def string_reorder_sorting(s):
    # Sort the string directly
    return ''.join(sorted(s))

def solve_string_reorder_sorting():
    s = input().strip()
    result = string_reorder_sorting(s)
    print(result)
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n log n) for sorting
**Space Complexity:** O(n) for temporary list

**Why it's better:**
- O(n log n) time complexity is much better than O(n!)
- Uses efficient sorting algorithms
- Suitable for competitive programming
- Handles large strings efficiently

### Approach 3: Character Frequency Counting (Optimal)

**Key Insights from Frequency Counting Solution:**
- Count frequency of each character
- Construct result by placing characters in lexicographic order
- Most efficient approach for this problem
- Standard method in competitive programming

**Algorithm:**
1. Count frequency of each character using array
2. Iterate through characters in lexicographic order
3. Append each character according to its frequency
4. Construct the final result

**Visual Example:**
```
Frequency counting: Count and construct
For string "CAB":

Step 1: Count frequencies
freq[A] = 1, freq[B] = 1, freq[C] = 1

Step 2: Construct result
result = ""
for i in range(26):
    result += chr(ord('A') + i) * freq[i]

Result: "A" + "B" + "C" = "ABC"
```

**Implementation:**
```python
def string_reorder_optimal(s):
    # Count character frequencies
    freq = [0] * 26
    for c in s:
        freq[ord(c) - ord('A')] += 1
    
    # Construct lexicographically smallest string
    result = ""
    for i in range(26):
        result += chr(ord('A') + i) * freq[i]
    
    return result

def solve_string_reorder():
    s = input().strip()
    result = string_reorder_optimal(s)
    print(result)

# Main execution
if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve_string_reorder()
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n) for counting and construction
**Space Complexity:** O(1) for frequency array

**Why it's optimal:**
- O(n) time complexity is optimal for this problem
- Uses constant space for frequency counting
- Most efficient approach for competitive programming
- Handles all cases correctly
