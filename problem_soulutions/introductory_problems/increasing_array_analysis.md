## Problem Description

**Problem**: You are given an array of n integers. You want to modify the array so that it becomes strictly increasing. In one operation, you can increase any element by 1. Find the minimum number of operations needed.

**Input**: 
- First line: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2×10⁵)
- Second line: n integers a₁, a₂, ..., aₙ (1 ≤ aᵢ ≤ 10⁹)

**Output**: The minimum number of operations needed.

**Constraints**:
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 2×10⁵
- 1 ≤ aᵢ ≤ 10⁹
- Can only increase elements (not decrease)
- Array must become strictly increasing
- Find minimum operations needed

**Example**:
```
Input:
5
3 2 5 1 7

Output:
5

Explanation: 
3 2 5 1 7 → 3 3 5 1 7 → 3 3 5 2 7 → 3 3 5 3 7 → 3 3 5 4 7 → 3 3 5 5 7
Operations: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5
```

## Visual Example

### Input and Array Analysis
```
Input: n = 5, arr = [3, 2, 5, 1, 7]

Original array: [3, 2, 5, 1, 7]
Target: Strictly increasing array
Operations: Can only increase elements by 1
```

### Greedy Transformation Process
```
Step-by-step transformation:

Initial: [3, 2, 5, 1, 7]
         ↑  ↑  ↑  ↑  ↑
         0  1  2  3  4

Step 1: Compare arr[1] with arr[0]
        arr[1] = 2 ≤ arr[0] = 3
        Need to increase arr[1] by 1
        Operations: 1
        Result: [3, 3, 5, 1, 7]

Step 2: Compare arr[2] with arr[1]
        arr[2] = 5 > arr[1] = 3
        No operation needed
        Result: [3, 3, 5, 1, 7]

Step 3: Compare arr[3] with arr[2]
        arr[3] = 1 ≤ arr[2] = 5
        Need to increase arr[3] by 4
        Operations: 4
        Result: [3, 3, 5, 5, 7]

Step 4: Compare arr[4] with arr[3]
        arr[4] = 7 > arr[3] = 5
        No operation needed
        Result: [3, 3, 5, 5, 7]

Total operations: 1 + 4 = 5
```

### Key Insight
The solution works by:
1. Processing array from left to right
2. Ensuring each element is greater than the previous
3. Calculating minimum increases needed
4. Time complexity: O(n) for single pass through array
5. Space complexity: O(1) for constant variables

## 🔍 Solution Analysis: From Brute Force to Optimal

### Approach 1: Brute Force with Array Modification (Inefficient)

**Key Insights from Brute Force Solution:**
- Modify the original array during processing
- Simple but memory-intensive approach
- Not suitable for large arrays due to memory usage
- Straightforward implementation but poor scalability

**Algorithm:**
1. Process array from left to right
2. If current element is not greater than previous, increase it
3. Modify the original array during processing
4. Count total operations needed

**Visual Example:**
```
Brute force: Modify original array
For arr = [3, 2, 5, 1, 7]:

Step 1: arr[1] = 2 ≤ arr[0] = 3
        Increase arr[1] by 1 → arr = [3, 3, 5, 1, 7]
        Operations: 1

Step 2: arr[2] = 5 > arr[1] = 3
        No change needed

Step 3: arr[3] = 1 ≤ arr[2] = 5
        Increase arr[3] by 4 → arr = [3, 3, 5, 5, 7]
        Operations: 4

Total operations: 5
```

**Implementation:**
```python
def increasing_array_brute_force(arr):
    operations = 0
    
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        if arr[i] <= arr[i-1]:
            # Need to increase current element
            needed = arr[i-1] - arr[i] + 1
            operations += needed
            arr[i] += needed  # Modify original array
    
    return operations

def solve_increasing_array_brute_force():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    result = increasing_array_brute_force(arr)
    print(result)
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n) for single pass through array
**Space Complexity:** O(1) for storing variables

**Why it's inefficient:**
- Modifies the original array unnecessarily
- Not suitable for cases where original array needs to be preserved
- Memory-intensive for large arrays
- Poor practice for array manipulation

### Approach 2: Greedy with Previous Value Tracking (Better)

**Key Insights from Greedy Solution:**
- Track previous value without modifying original array
- More memory-efficient than brute force approach
- Standard method for array transformation problems
- Can handle larger arrays than brute force approach

**Algorithm:**
1. Process array from left to right
2. Track the previous value without modifying original array
3. Calculate operations needed for current element
4. Update previous value for next iteration

**Visual Example:**
```
Greedy approach: Track previous value
For arr = [3, 2, 5, 1, 7]:

Step 1: prev = 3, arr[1] = 2
        arr[1] ≤ prev, need to increase by 1
        Operations: 1, prev = 3

Step 2: prev = 3, arr[2] = 5
        arr[2] > prev, no operation needed
        prev = 5

Step 3: prev = 5, arr[3] = 1
        arr[3] ≤ prev, need to increase by 4
        Operations: 4, prev = 5

Step 4: prev = 5, arr[4] = 7
        arr[4] > prev, no operation needed
        prev = 7

Total operations: 5
```

**Implementation:**
```python
def increasing_array_greedy(arr):
    operations = 0
    prev = arr[0]
    
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        if arr[i] <= prev:
            # Need to increase current element
            needed = prev - arr[i] + 1
            operations += needed
            prev = arr[i] + needed
        else:
            prev = arr[i]
    
    return operations

def solve_increasing_array_greedy():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    result = increasing_array_greedy(arr)
    print(result)
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n) for single pass through array
**Space Complexity:** O(1) for storing variables

**Why it's better:**
- Doesn't modify the original array
- More memory-efficient than brute force
- Suitable for competitive programming
- Efficient for most practical cases

### Approach 3: Optimized Greedy with Mathematical Analysis (Optimal)

**Key Insights from Optimized Solution:**
- Use mathematical analysis for optimal greedy strategy
- Most efficient approach for array transformation
- Standard method in competitive programming
- Can handle the maximum constraint efficiently

**Algorithm:**
1. Process array in single pass from left to right
2. Use mathematical formula to calculate minimum operations
3. Track previous value efficiently
4. Leverage greedy properties for optimal solution

**Visual Example:**
```
Optimized approach: Mathematical analysis
For arr = [3, 2, 5, 1, 7]:

Mathematical formula: needed = max(0, prev - arr[i] + 1)

Step 1: prev = 3, arr[1] = 2
        needed = max(0, 3 - 2 + 1) = 2
        Operations: 2, prev = 2 + 2 = 4

Step 2: prev = 4, arr[2] = 5
        needed = max(0, 4 - 5 + 1) = 0
        Operations: 0, prev = 5

Step 3: prev = 5, arr[3] = 1
        needed = max(0, 5 - 1 + 1) = 5
        Operations: 5, prev = 1 + 5 = 6

Step 4: prev = 6, arr[4] = 7
        needed = max(0, 6 - 7 + 1) = 0
        Operations: 0, prev = 7

Total operations: 2 + 0 + 5 + 0 = 7
```

**Implementation:**
```python
def increasing_array_optimized(arr):
    operations = 0
    prev = arr[0]
    
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        if arr[i] <= prev:
            needed = prev - arr[i] + 1
            operations += needed
            prev = arr[i] + needed
        else:
            prev = arr[i]
    
    return operations

def solve_increasing_array():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    result = increasing_array_optimized(arr)
    print(result)

# Main execution
if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve_increasing_array()
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n) for single pass through array
**Space Complexity:** O(1) for storing variables

**Why it's optimal:**
- O(n) time complexity is optimal for this problem
- Uses mathematical analysis for efficient solution
- Most efficient approach for competitive programming
- Standard method for array transformation optimization
