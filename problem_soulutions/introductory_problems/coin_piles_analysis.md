## Problem Description

**Problem**: You have two coin piles containing a and b coins. On each move, you can either remove 1 coin from the left pile and 2 coins from the right pile, or remove 2 coins from the left pile and 1 coin from the right pile. Determine if it's possible to empty both piles.

**Input**: 
- First line: t (number of test cases)
- Next t lines: two integers a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10⁹)

**Output**: For each test case, print "YES" if possible, "NO" otherwise.

**Constraints**:
- 1 ≤ t ≤ 10⁵
- 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10⁹
- Each move removes exactly 3 coins total
- Only two types of moves are allowed
- Goal is to empty both piles completely

**Example**:
```
Input:
3
2 1
2 2
3 3

Output:
NO
YES
YES
```

## Visual Example

### Input and Move Types
```
Two possible moves:
Move Type 1: Remove 1 from left pile, 2 from right pile
Move Type 2: Remove 2 from left pile, 1 from right pile

Each move removes exactly 3 coins total.
```

### Case Analysis
```
Case 1: a=2, b=1
Initial: [2, 1]
Total coins: 2 + 1 = 3 ✓ (divisible by 3)
Check constraint: 2 > 2*1 = 2 ✗ (impossible)
Result: NO

Case 2: a=2, b=2
Initial: [2, 2]
Total coins: 2 + 2 = 4 ✗ (not divisible by 3)
Result: NO

Case 3: a=3, b=3
Initial: [3, 3]
Total coins: 3 + 3 = 6 ✓ (divisible by 3)
Check constraint: 3 ≤ 2*3 = 6 ✓ and 3 ≤ 2*3 = 6 ✓
Result: YES
```

### Mathematical Analysis
```
Let x = number of Move Type 1
Let y = number of Move Type 2

Final state: (a - x - 2y, b - 2x - y)
We need: a - x - 2y = 0 and b - 2x - y = 0

Solving:
a = x + 2y
b = 2x + y
Adding: a + b = 3x + 3y = 3(x + y)

Therefore: (a + b) must be divisible by 3
And: a ≤ 2b and b ≤ 2a
```

### Key Insight
The solution works by:
1. Checking if total coins (a + b) is divisible by 3
2. Checking if both piles can be emptied with the given moves
3. Using mathematical constraints to determine possibility
4. Time complexity: O(1) per test case
5. Space complexity: O(1)

## 🔍 Solution Analysis: From Brute Force to Optimal

### Approach 1: Brute Force Simulation (Inefficient)

**Key Insights from Brute Force Solution:**
- Try all possible sequences of moves to see if we can empty both piles
- Simple but computationally expensive approach
- Not suitable for large numbers
- Straightforward implementation but poor performance

**Algorithm:**
1. Try all possible combinations of Move Type 1 and Move Type 2
2. For each combination, simulate the moves
3. Check if both piles can be emptied
4. Return "YES" if any combination works, "NO" otherwise

**Visual Example:**
```
Brute force: Try all move combinations
For a=3, b=3:
- Try 0 moves of type 1, 0 moves of type 2: [3,3] → not empty
- Try 1 move of type 1, 0 moves of type 2: [2,1] → not empty
- Try 0 moves of type 1, 1 move of type 2: [1,2] → not empty
- Try 1 move of type 1, 1 move of type 2: [0,0] → empty! ✓
- Try all possible combinations
```

**Implementation:**
```python
def coin_piles_brute_force(a, b):
    # Try all possible combinations of moves
    max_moves = (a + b) // 3  # Maximum possible moves
    
    for moves_type1 in range(max_moves + 1):
        for moves_type2 in range(max_moves + 1):
            # Calculate final state
            final_a = a - moves_type1 - 2 * moves_type2
            final_b = b - 2 * moves_type1 - moves_type2
            
            # Check if both piles are empty
            if final_a == 0 and final_b == 0:
                return "YES"
    
    return "NO"

def solve_coin_piles_brute_force():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        result = coin_piles_brute_force(a, b)
        print(result)
```

**Time Complexity:** O((a+b)²) for each test case with nested loops
**Space Complexity:** O(1) for storing variables

**Why it's inefficient:**
- O((a+b)²) time complexity is too slow for large numbers
- Not suitable for competitive programming with a, b up to 10^9
- Inefficient for large inputs
- Poor performance with many test cases

### Approach 2: Mathematical Analysis with Constraints (Better)

**Key Insights from Mathematical Analysis Solution:**
- Use mathematical analysis to derive necessary conditions
- Much more efficient than brute force approach
- Standard method for constraint satisfaction problems
- Can handle larger inputs than brute force

**Algorithm:**
1. Check if total coins (a + b) is divisible by 3
2. Check if both piles can be emptied with the given moves
3. Use mathematical constraints to determine possibility
4. Return result based on mathematical analysis

**Visual Example:**
```
Mathematical analysis for a=3, b=3:
- Total coins: 3 + 3 = 6 ✓ (divisible by 3)
- Check constraint: 3 ≤ 2*3 = 6 ✓ and 3 ≤ 2*3 = 6 ✓
- Result: YES
```

**Implementation:**
```python
def coin_piles_mathematical(a, b):
    # Check if total is divisible by 3
    if (a + b) % 3 != 0:
        return "NO"
    
    # Check if both piles can be emptied
    # We need: a ≤ 2b and b ≤ 2a
    if a > 2 * b or b > 2 * a:
        return "NO"
    
    return "YES"

def solve_coin_piles_mathematical():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        result = coin_piles_mathematical(a, b)
        print(result)
```

**Time Complexity:** O(1) for each test case with mathematical analysis
**Space Complexity:** O(1) for storing variables

**Why it's better:**
- O(1) time complexity is much better than O((a+b)²)
- Uses mathematical analysis for efficient solution
- Suitable for competitive programming
- Efficient for all practical cases

### Approach 3: Optimized Mathematical Solution (Optimal)

**Key Insights from Optimized Mathematical Solution:**
- Use optimized mathematical analysis with efficient constraints
- Most efficient approach for constraint satisfaction problems
- Standard method in competitive programming
- Can handle the maximum constraint efficiently

**Algorithm:**
1. Use optimized mathematical analysis
2. Check divisibility and constraints efficiently
3. Return result based on optimized mathematical analysis
4. Handle edge cases efficiently

**Visual Example:**
```
Optimized mathematical analysis for a=3, b=3:
- Optimized divisibility check: (3 + 3) % 3 == 0 ✓
- Optimized constraint check: 3 ≤ 2*3 and 3 ≤ 2*3 ✓
- Result: YES
```

**Implementation:**
```python
def coin_piles_optimized(a, b):
    # Optimized mathematical analysis
    total = a + b
    
    # Check if total is divisible by 3
    if total % 3 != 0:
        return "NO"
    
    # Check if both piles can be emptied efficiently
    # We need: a ≤ 2b and b ≤ 2a
    if a > 2 * b or b > 2 * a:
        return "NO"
    
    return "YES"

def solve_coin_piles():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        result = coin_piles_optimized(a, b)
        print(result)

# Main execution
if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve_coin_piles()
```

**Time Complexity:** O(1) for each test case with optimized mathematical analysis
**Space Complexity:** O(1) for storing variables

**Why it's optimal:**
- O(1) time complexity is optimal for constraint satisfaction problems
- Uses optimized mathematical analysis
- Most efficient approach for competitive programming
- Standard method for mathematical constraint problems
