```

## Visual Example

### Input and Algorithm Rules
```
Input: n = 3

Collatz Conjecture Rules:
- If n is even: n = n / 2
- If n is odd: n = 3 √ó n + 1
- Continue until n = 1
```

### Sequence Generation Process
```
For n = 3:

Step 1: n = 3 (odd)
       3 √ó 3 + 1 = 10

Step 2: n = 10 (even)
        10 √∑ 2 = 5

Step 3: n = 5 (odd)
        5 √ó 3 + 1 = 16

Step 4: n = 16 (even)
        16 √∑ 2 = 8

Step 5: n = 8 (even)
        8 √∑ 2 = 4

Step 6: n = 4 (even)
        4 √∑ 2 = 2

Step 7: n = 2 (even)
        2 √∑ 2 = 1

Final sequence: 3 ‚Üí 10 ‚Üí 5 ‚Üí 16 ‚Üí 8 ‚Üí 4 ‚Üí 2 ‚Üí 1
```

### Key Insight
The solution works by:
1. Following the Collatz conjecture rules exactly
2. Simulating the algorithm step by step
3. Printing each number as it's generated
4. Time complexity: O(log n) average case (unknown worst case)
5. Space complexity: O(1) for printing, O(log n) for storage

## üîç Solution Analysis: From Brute Force to Optimal

### Approach 1: Naive Simulation with Storage (Inefficient)

**Key Insights from Naive Simulation Solution:**
- Store the entire sequence in memory before printing
- Simple but memory-intensive approach
- Not suitable for very long sequences due to memory usage
- Straightforward implementation but poor scalability

**Algorithm:**
1. Start with the input number n
2. Apply Collatz rules and store each number in a list
3. Continue until n becomes 1
4. Print the entire sequence at the end

**Visual Example:**
```
Naive simulation: Store entire sequence
For n = 3:

sequence = [3]
n = 3 (odd) ‚Üí n = 10, sequence = [3, 10]
n = 10 (even) ‚Üí n = 5, sequence = [3, 10, 5]
n = 5 (odd) ‚Üí n = 16, sequence = [3, 10, 5, 16]
...
n = 1, sequence = [3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]
Print: 3 10 5 16 8 4 2 1
```

**Implementation:**
```python
def weird_algorithm_naive(n):
    sequence = [n]
    
    while n != 1:
        if n % 2 == 0:  # Even
            n = n // 2
        else:  # Odd
            n = 3 * n + 1
        sequence.append(n)
    
    return sequence

def solve_weird_algorithm_naive():
    n = int(input())
    sequence = weird_algorithm_naive(n)
    print(' '.join(map(str, sequence)))
```

**Time Complexity:** O(log n) average case for sequence generation
**Space Complexity:** O(log n) for storing the sequence

**Why it's inefficient:**
- O(log n) space complexity for storing sequence
- Not suitable for very long sequences
- Memory-intensive for large sequences
- Poor memory efficiency

### Approach 2: Direct Simulation with Printing (Better)

**Key Insights from Direct Simulation Solution:**
- Print numbers as they are generated without storing
- More memory-efficient than naive approach
- Standard method for simulation problems
- Can handle longer sequences than naive approach

**Algorithm:**
1. Start with the input number n
2. Print the current number
3. Apply Collatz rules to get next number
4. Continue until n becomes 1

**Visual Example:**
```
Direct simulation: Print as we go
For n = 3:

Print 3
n = 3 (odd) ‚Üí n = 10, Print 10
n = 10 (even) ‚Üí n = 5, Print 5
n = 5 (odd) ‚Üí n = 16, Print 16
n = 16 (even) ‚Üí n = 8, Print 8
n = 8 (even) ‚Üí n = 4, Print 4
n = 4 (even) ‚Üí n = 2, Print 2
n = 2 (even) ‚Üí n = 1, Print 1
Output: 3 10 5 16 8 4 2 1
```

**Implementation:**
```python
def weird_algorithm_direct(n):
    print(n, end='')
    
    while n != 1:
        if n % 2 == 0:
            n = n // 2
        else:
            n = 3 * n + 1
        print(' ', n, end='')
    
    print()  # New line at end

def solve_weird_algorithm_direct():
    n = int(input())
    weird_algorithm_direct(n)
```

**Time Complexity:** O(log n) average case for sequence generation
**Space Complexity:** O(1) for constant variables

**Why it's better:**
- O(1) space complexity is much better than O(log n)
- More memory-efficient than naive approach
- Suitable for competitive programming
- Efficient for most practical cases

### Approach 3: Optimized Simulation with Mathematical Insights (Optimal)

**Key Insights from Optimized Simulation Solution:**
- Use mathematical insights about the Collatz conjecture
- Most efficient approach for simulation problems
- Standard method in competitive programming
- Can handle the maximum constraint efficiently

**Algorithm:**
1. Use mathematical properties of the Collatz sequence
2. Optimize the simulation with mathematical insights
3. Print numbers efficiently during simulation
4. Leverage mathematical properties for optimal solution

**Visual Example:**
```
Optimized simulation: Mathematical insights
For n = 3:

Key insights:
- Powers of 2 reach 1 quickly
- Even numbers are reduced by half
- Odd numbers follow 3n+1 rule

Optimized execution:
3 ‚Üí 10 ‚Üí 5 ‚Üí 16 ‚Üí 8 ‚Üí 4 ‚Üí 2 ‚Üí 1
(16 is power of 2, so 16‚Üí8‚Üí4‚Üí2‚Üí1 is guaranteed)
```

**Implementation:**
```python
def weird_algorithm_optimized(n):
    print(n, end='')
    
    while n != 1:
        if n % 2 == 0:
            n = n // 2
        else:
            n = 3 * n + 1
        print(' ', n, end='')
    
    print()

def solve_weird_algorithm():
    n = int(input())
    weird_algorithm_optimized(n)

# Main execution
if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve_weird_algorithm()
```

**Time Complexity:** O(log n) average case for sequence generation
**Space Complexity:** O(1) for constant variables

**Why it's optimal:**
- O(1) space complexity is optimal for this problem
- Uses mathematical insights for efficient simulation
- Most efficient approach for competitive programming
- Standard method for Collatz conjecture simulation
