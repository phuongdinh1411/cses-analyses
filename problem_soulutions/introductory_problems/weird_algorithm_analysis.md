# CSES Weird Algorithm - Problem Analysis

## Problem Statement
Consider an algorithm that takes as input a positive integer n. If n is even, the algorithm divides it by two, and if n is odd, the algorithm multiplies it by three and adds one. The algorithm repeats this, until n is one.

For example, the sequence for n=3 is as follows:
3â†’10â†’5â†’16â†’8â†’4â†’2â†’1

Your task is to simulate the execution of the algorithm for a given value of n.

### Input
The only input line contains an integer n.

### Output
Print a line that contains all values of n during the algorithm.

### Constraints
- 1 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 10^6

### Example
```
Input:
3

Output:
3 10 5 16 8 4 2 1
```

## Solution Progression

### Approach 1: Direct Simulation - O(log n)
**Description**: Follow the algorithm rules directly and simulate each step.

```python
def weird_algorithm_direct(n):
    sequence = [n]
    
    while n != 1:
        if n % 2 == 0:
            n = n // 2
        else:
            n = 3 * n + 1
        sequence.append(n)
    
    return sequence
```

**Why this is efficient**: The algorithm naturally terminates when n reaches 1. For most numbers, this happens relatively quickly, making the direct simulation approach optimal.

### Alternative: Recursive Approach - O(log n)
**Description**: Use recursion to simulate the algorithm.

```python
def weird_algorithm_recursive(n):
    if n == 1:
        return [1]
    
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return [n] + weird_algorithm_recursive(n // 2)
    else:
        return [n] + weird_algorithm_recursive(3 * n + 1)
```

**Why this works**: The recursive approach follows the same logic but uses the call stack instead of a loop. It's elegant but may cause stack overflow for very large sequences.

### Alternative: Iterative with Vector - O(log n)
**Description**: Use a vector to store the sequence and print it at the end.

```python
def weird_algorithm_vector(n):
    sequence = []
    
    while n != 1:
        sequence.append(n)
        if n % 2 == 0:
            n = n // 2
        else:
            n = 3 * n + 1
    
    sequence.append(1)
    return sequence
```

**Why this works**: This approach stores the entire sequence in memory before printing, which can be useful if you need to process the sequence later.

## Final Optimal Solution

```python
n = int(input())
print(n, end='')

while n != 1:
    if n % 2 == 0:
        n = n // 2
    else:
        n = 3 * n + 1
    print(f" {n}", end='')
print()
```

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(log n) - The algorithm typically converges to 1 in logarithmic time
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) - We only store the current value

## Notable Techniques

### 1. **Direct Algorithm Implementation**
```python
# Follow algorithm rules directly
while n != target:
    if condition:
        n = operation1(n)
    else:
        n = operation2(n)
```

### 2. **Output Formatting Pattern**
```python
# Print with specific formatting
print(n, end='')
while condition:
    n = update(n)
    print(f" {n}", end='')
print()  # Final newline
```

### 3. **Sequence Generation**
```python
# Generate sequence step by step
sequence = [n]
while n != target:
    n = next_value(n)
    sequence.append(n)
```

## Edge Cases to Remember

1. **n = 1**: Already at target, no operations needed
2. **Large n**: Algorithm may take many steps but will eventually reach 1
3. **Integer overflow**: For very large n, 3n+1 might overflow (though unlikely in practice)
4. **Output format**: Ensure proper spacing between numbers

## Problem-Solving Framework

1. **Read algorithm carefully**: Understand the exact rules
2. **Implement directly**: Don't overcomplicate the solution
3. **Handle edge cases**: Consider special input values
4. **Format output correctly**: Pay attention to spacing and formatting
5. **Test with examples**: Verify with given test cases

    while n != 1:
        if n % 2 == 0:
            n = n // 2
