### 📚 **Prerequisites**

## Problem Description

**Problem**: Simulate the Collatz conjecture algorithm. Start with a positive integer n. If n is even, divide by 2; if n is odd, multiply by 3 and add 1. Repeat until n becomes 1.

**Input**: An integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10⁶)

**Output**: Print all values of n during the algorithm execution

**Example**:
```
Input: 3
Output: 3 10 5 16 8 4 2 1

Explanation: 3→10→5→16→8→4→2→1
```

## 🎯 Solution Progression

### Step 1: Understanding the Problem
**What are we trying to do?**
- Start with a number n
- Apply rules: if even → divide by 2, if odd → multiply by 3 and add 1
- Continue until we reach 1
- Print all numbers in the sequence

**Key Observations:**
- The algorithm always terminates (though this is unproven for all numbers)
- We need to print each number as we process it
- The sequence can be quite long for some numbers

### Step 2: Direct Simulation
**Idea**: Follow the algorithm rules exactly as stated.

```python
def solve_weird_algorithm(n):
    sequence = [n]
    
    while n != 1:
        if n % 2 == 0:  # Even
            n = n // 2
        else:  # Odd
            n = 3 * n + 1
        sequence.append(n)
    
    return sequence
```

**Why this works:**
- We follow the exact rules given in the problem
- We continue until n becomes 1
- We collect all numbers in the sequence

### Step 3: Print During Execution
**Idea**: Print numbers as we go, not store them all.

```python
def solve_with_printing(n):
    print(n, end='')  # Print first number
    
    while n != 1:
        if n % 2 == 0:
            n = n // 2
        else:
            n = 3 * n + 1
        print(' ', n, end='')  # Print with space
    
    print()  # New line at end
```

**Why this is better:**
- More memory efficient (don't store sequence)
- Matches the expected output format exactly
- Faster for very long sequences

### Step 4: Complete Solution
**Putting it all together:**

```python
def solve_weird_algorithm():
    n = int(input())
    
    print(n, end='')
    
    while n != 1:
        if n % 2 == 0:
            n = n // 2
        else:
            n = 3 * n + 1
        print(' ', n, end='')
    
    print()

# Main execution
if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve_weird_algorithm()
```

### Step 5: Testing Our Solution
**Let's verify with examples:**

```python
def test_solution():
    test_cases = [
        (1, [1]),
        (2, [2, 1]),
        (3, [3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]),
        (4, [4, 2, 1]),
    ]
    
    for n, expected in test_cases:
        result = solve_test(n)
        print(f"n = {n}")
        print(f"Expected: {expected}")
        print(f"Got: {result}")
        print(f"{'✓ PASS' if result == expected else '✗ FAIL'}")
        print()

def solve_test(n):
    sequence = [n]
    
    while n != 1:
        if n % 2 == 0:
            n = n // 2
        else:
            n = 3 * n + 1
        sequence.append(n)
    
    return sequence

test_solution()
```

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Time Complexity
- **Worst Case**: Unknown (depends on the Collatz conjecture)
- **Average Case**: O(log n) for most numbers
- **Best Case**: O(1) when n is a power of 2

### Space Complexity
- **With Storage**: O(log n) - to store the sequence
- **Without Storage**: O(1) - just print as we go

### Why This Algorithm Works
- **Mathematical**: Based on the famous Collatz conjecture
- **Termination**: Empirically, all tested numbers reach 1
- **Efficiency**: Most numbers reach 1 relatively quickly

## 🎨 Visual Example

### Input Example
```
Input: n = 3
Output: 3 10 5 16 8 4 2 1
```

### Algorithm Execution
```
Start: n = 3

Step 1: n = 3 (odd)
3 × 3 + 1 = 10

Step 2: n = 10 (even)
10 ÷ 2 = 5

Step 3: n = 5 (odd)
5 × 3 + 1 = 16

Step 4: n = 16 (even)
16 ÷ 2 = 8

Step 5: n = 8 (even)
8 ÷ 2 = 4

Step 6: n = 4 (even)
4 ÷ 2 = 2

Step 7: n = 2 (even)
2 ÷ 2 = 1

Step 8: n = 1 (terminate)
```

### Sequence Visualization
```
3 → 10 → 5 → 16 → 8 → 4 → 2 → 1

3 (odd)  → 3×3+1 = 10
10 (even) → 10÷2 = 5
5 (odd)   → 5×3+1 = 16
16 (even) → 16÷2 = 8
8 (even)  → 8÷2 = 4
4 (even)  → 4÷2 = 2
2 (even)  → 2÷2 = 1
1 (stop)
```

### Different Examples
```
n = 1: 1
n = 2: 2 → 1
n = 4: 4 → 2 → 1
n = 5: 5 → 16 → 8 → 4 → 2 → 1
n = 6: 6 → 3 → 10 → 5 → 16 → 8 → 4 → 2 → 1
n = 7: 7 → 22 → 11 → 34 → 17 → 52 → 26 → 13 → 40 → 20 → 10 → 5 → 16 → 8 → 4 → 2 → 1
```

### Pattern Analysis
```
Common patterns:
- Even numbers always decrease (divide by 2)
- Odd numbers increase (multiply by 3, add 1)
- Most sequences eventually reach powers of 2
- Powers of 2 quickly reach 1

Example with n = 6:
6 → 3 → 10 → 5 → 16 → 8 → 4 → 2 → 1
↑   ↑   ↑    ↑   ↑    ↑   ↑   ↑   ↑
even odd even odd even even even even
```

### Algorithm Flow
```
Input: n
Output: sequence of numbers

while n != 1:
    print(n, end=" ")
    if n % 2 == 0:
        n = n // 2
    else:
        n = 3 * n + 1
print(1)
```

### Memory Efficiency
```
Method 1: Store entire sequence
sequence = [3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]
print(" ".join(map(str, sequence)))

Method 2: Print as we go (more efficient)
print(3, end=" ")
print(10, end=" ")
print(5, end=" ")
...
print(1)
```

## 🎯 Problem Variations

### Variation 1: Modified Collatz Rules
**Problem**: Instead of 3n+1 for odd numbers, use 3n+2. How does this affect convergence?

```python
def modified_collatz(n):
    sequence = [n]
    while n != 1:
        if n % 2 == 0:
            n = n // 2
        else:
            n = 3 * n + 2  # Changed from +1 to +2
        sequence.append(n)
    return sequence
```

### Variation 2: Find Maximum Value in Sequence
**Problem**: Given n, find the maximum value reached during the Collatz sequence.

```python
def max_in_collatz_sequence(n):
    max_val = n
    while n != 1:
        if n % 2 == 0:
            n = n // 2
        else:
            n = 3 * n + 1
        max_val = max(max_val, n)
    return max_val
```

### Variation 3: Count Steps to Reach 1
**Problem**: Count how many steps it takes to reach 1 from n.

```python
def collatz_steps(n):
    steps = 0
    while n != 1:
        if n % 2 == 0:
            n = n // 2
        else:
            n = 3 * n + 1
        steps += 1
    return steps
```

### Variation 4: Check if Sequence Reaches Target
**Problem**: Given n and target, check if the Collatz sequence ever reaches the target value.

```python
def reaches_target(n, target, max_steps=1000):
    steps = 0
    while n != 1 and steps < max_steps:
        if n == target:
            return True
        if n % 2 == 0:
            n = n // 2
        else:
            n = 3 * n + 1
        steps += 1
    return n == target
```
