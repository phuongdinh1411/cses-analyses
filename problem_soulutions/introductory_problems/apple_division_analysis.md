## 📋 Problem Description

Given n apples with weights, divide them into two groups such that the difference between the total weights of the two groups is minimized.

**Input**: 
- n: number of apples
- weights: array of apple weights

**Output**: 
- Minimum possible difference between the two groups

**Constraints**:
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 20
- 1 ≤ weight ≤ 10^9

**Example**:
```
Input:
n = 4
weights = [3, 2, 7, 4]

Output:
0

Explanation**: 
Optimal division:
Group 1: [3, 4] (total weight = 7)
Group 2: [2, 7] (total weight = 9)
Difference: |7 - 9| = 2

Actually, better division:
Group 1: [3, 7] (total weight = 10)
Group 2: [2, 4] (total weight = 6)
Difference: |10 - 6| = 4

Wait, let me recalculate:
Group 1: [2, 7] (total weight = 9)
Group 2: [3, 4] (total weight = 7)
Difference: |9 - 7| = 2

Actually, the minimum difference is 2, not 0.

**Visual Example**:
```
Apples: [3, 2, 7, 4]

Try all possible divisions:
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Division 1: Group1=[], Group2=[3,2,7,4] │
│ - Group1 weight: 0                  │
│ - Group2 weight: 16                 │
│ - Difference: |0 - 16| = 16         │
│                                   │
│ Division 2: Group1=[3], Group2=[2,7,4] │
│ - Group1 weight: 3                 │
│ - Group2 weight: 13                │
│ - Difference: |3 - 13| = 10        │
│                                   │
│ Division 3: Group1=[2], Group2=[3,7,4] │
│ - Group1 weight: 2                 │
│ - Group2 weight: 14                │
│ - Difference: |2 - 14| = 12        │
│                                   │
│ Division 4: Group1=[3,2], Group2=[7,4] │
│ - Group1 weight: 5                 │
│ - Group2 weight: 11                │
│ - Difference: |5 - 11| = 6         │
│                                   │
│ Division 5: Group1=[3,7], Group2=[2,4] │
│ - Group1 weight: 10                │
│ - Group2 weight: 6                 │
│ - Difference: |10 - 6| = 4         │
│                                   │
│ Division 6: Group1=[2,7], Group2=[3,4] │
│ - Group1 weight: 9                 │
│ - Group2 weight: 7                 │
│ - Difference: |9 - 7| = 2         │
│                                   │
│ Continue for all 2^4 = 16 divisions │
│                                   │
│ Minimum difference: 2              │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Implementation**:
```python
def brute_force_apple_division(n, weights):
    """Find minimum difference using brute force approach"""
    min_difference = float('inf')
    
    # Try all possible subsets (2^n possibilities)
    for mask in range(1 << n):
        group1_weight = 0
        group2_weight = 0
        
        # Calculate weights for both groups
        for i in range(n):
            if mask & (1 << i):
                group1_weight += weights[i]
            else:
                group2_weight += weights[i]
        
        # Calculate difference
        difference = abs(group1_weight - group2_weight)
        min_difference = min(min_difference, difference)
    
    return min_difference

# Example usage
n = 4
weights = [3, 2, 7, 4]
result = brute_force_apple_division(n, weights)
print(f"Brute force minimum difference: {result}")
```

**Time Complexity**: O(2^n × n)
**Space Complexity**: O(1)

**Why it's inefficient**: O(2^n × n) time complexity for trying all possible subsets.

### Approach 2: Optimized Brute Force

**Key Insights from Optimized Brute Force**:
- **Early Termination**: Stop when difference becomes 0
- **Symmetry Optimization**: Only check half of the subsets due to symmetry
- **Efficient Implementation**: O(2^n × n) time complexity but with optimizations
- **Optimization**: Better than basic brute force

**Key Insight**: Use optimizations to reduce the number of subsets to check.

**Algorithm**:
- Use bitmasking to generate subsets efficiently
- Apply symmetry optimization to check only half of subsets
- Use early termination when difference becomes 0
- Return minimum difference found

**Visual Example**:
```
Optimized Brute Force:

Apples: [3, 2, 7, 4]

Use symmetry optimization:
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Only check subsets with size ≤ n/2  │
│ (due to symmetry)                   │
│                                   │
│ Check subsets:                     │
│ - Size 0: [] (skip, already checked) │
│ - Size 1: [3], [2], [7], [4]      │
│ - Size 2: [3,2], [3,7], [3,4], [2,7], [2,4], [7,4] │
│                                   │
│ For each subset:                   │
│ - Calculate group1 weight          │
│ - Calculate group2 weight          │
│ - Calculate difference             │
│ - Update minimum if better         │
│                                   │
│ Early termination:                 │
│ - If difference = 0, return 0      │
│                                   │
│ Result: 2                          │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Implementation**:
```python
def optimized_brute_force_apple_division(n, weights):
    """Find minimum difference using optimized brute force approach"""
    min_difference = float('inf')
    total_weight = sum(weights)
    
    # Use symmetry: only check subsets with size <= n/2
    max_subset_size = n // 2
    
    for mask in range(1, 1 << n):
        # Count number of set bits (subset size)
        subset_size = bin(mask).count('1')
        
        # Skip if subset size > n/2 (due to symmetry)
        if subset_size > max_subset_size:
            continue
        
        group1_weight = 0
        
        # Calculate weight of first group
        for i in range(n):
            if mask & (1 << i):
                group1_weight += weights[i]
        
        # Calculate weight of second group
        group2_weight = total_weight - group1_weight
        
        # Calculate difference
        difference = abs(group1_weight - group2_weight)
        min_difference = min(min_difference, difference)
        
        # Early termination
        if min_difference == 0:
            return 0
    
    return min_difference

# Example usage
n = 4
weights = [3, 2, 7, 4]
result = optimized_brute_force_apple_division(n, weights)
print(f"Optimized brute force minimum difference: {result}")
```

**Time Complexity**: O(2^n × n)
**Space Complexity**: O(1)

**Why it's better**: Uses optimizations to reduce the number of subsets to check.

        # Advanced weight calculation
        group1_weight = 0
        for i in range(n):
            if mask & (1 << i):
                group1_weight += weights[i]
        
        # Advanced difference calculation
        group2_weight = total_weight - group1_weight
        difference = abs(group1_weight - group2_weight)
        
        # Advanced minimum tracking
        min_difference = min(min_difference, difference)
        
        # Advanced early termination
        if min_difference == 0:
            return 0
    
    return min_difference

# Example usage
