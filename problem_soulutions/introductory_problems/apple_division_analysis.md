## Problem Description

**Problem**: Given n apples with weights w‚ÇÅ, w‚ÇÇ, ..., w‚Çô, divide them into two groups such that the difference between the total weights of the two groups is minimized.

**Input**: 
- First line: n (1 ‚â§ n ‚â§ 20)
- Second line: n integers w‚ÇÅ, w‚ÇÇ, ..., w‚Çô (1 ‚â§ w·µ¢ ‚â§ 10‚Åπ)

**Output**: The minimum possible difference between the two groups.

**Constraints**:
- 1 ‚â§ n ‚â§ 20
- 1 ‚â§ w·µ¢ ‚â§ 10‚Åπ
- Must divide into exactly 2 groups
- Each apple goes to exactly one group
- Find minimum weight difference

**Example**:
```
Input:
5
3 2 7 4 1

Output:
1

Explanation: Group 1: {3, 2, 1} = 6, Group 2: {7, 4} = 11, Difference = |11-6| = 5
But better: Group 1: {3, 2, 4} = 9, Group 2: {7, 1} = 8, Difference = |9-8| = 1
```

## Visual Example

### Input and Weight Analysis
```
Input: n = 5, weights = [3, 2, 7, 4, 1]

Apple weights: [3, 2, 7, 4, 1]
Total weight: 3 + 2 + 7 + 4 + 1 = 17
Target: Minimize difference between two groups
```

### Bitmask Representation
```
For n = 5 apples, we have 2^5 = 32 possible divisions:

Bitmask 00000: Group 1 = [], Group 2 = [3,2,7,4,1]
Bitmask 00001: Group 1 = [1], Group 2 = [3,2,7,4]
Bitmask 00010: Group 1 = [4], Group 2 = [3,2,7,1]
Bitmask 00011: Group 1 = [4,1], Group 2 = [3,2,7]
...
Bitmask 11111: Group 1 = [3,2,7,4,1], Group 2 = []
```

### Optimal Division Process
```
For weights = [3, 2, 7, 4, 1], total = 17:

Best division found:
Bitmask 01101: Group 1 = [2, 7, 1] = 10, Group 2 = [3, 4] = 7
Difference = |10 - 7| = 3

Even better:
Bitmask 10110: Group 1 = [3, 7, 4] = 14, Group 2 = [2, 1] = 3  
Difference = |14 - 3| = 11

Optimal:
Bitmask 11010: Group 1 = [3, 2, 4] = 9, Group 2 = [7, 1] = 8
Difference = |9 - 8| = 1 ‚úì
```

### Key Insight
The solution works by:
1. Using bitmasking to represent all possible divisions
2. Calculating weight difference for each division
3. Finding the minimum difference
4. Time complexity: O(n √ó 2^n) for checking all subsets
5. Space complexity: O(1) for storing variables

## üîç Solution Analysis: From Brute Force to Optimal

### Approach 1: Naive Brute Force (Inefficient)

**Key Insights from Naive Brute Force Solution:**
- Generate all possible subset divisions using bitmasking
- Simple but computationally expensive approach
- Not suitable for large n due to exponential growth
- Straightforward implementation but poor scalability

**Algorithm:**
1. Generate all possible bitmasks from 0 to 2^n - 1
2. For each bitmask, calculate group 1 weight
3. Calculate group 2 weight as total - group 1
4. Find minimum difference across all divisions

**Visual Example:**
```
Naive brute force: Check all divisions
For weights = [3, 2, 7, 4, 1]:

Check all 32 bitmasks:
00000: Group1=[], Group2=[3,2,7,4,1], Diff=|0-17|=17
00001: Group1=[1], Group2=[3,2,7,4], Diff=|1-16|=15
00010: Group1=[4], Group2=[3,2,7,1], Diff=|4-13|=9
...
11010: Group1=[3,2,4], Group2=[7,1], Diff=|9-8|=1 ‚úì
```

**Implementation:**
```python
def apple_division_naive(weights):
    n = len(weights)
    total_sum = sum(weights)
    min_diff = float('inf')
    
    # Try all possible divisions (2^n combinations)
    for mask in range(1 << n):
        group1_sum = 0
        for i in range(n):
            if mask & (1 << i):  # If bit i is set
                group1_sum += weights[i]
        
        # Calculate difference
        diff = abs(total_sum - 2 * group1_sum)
        min_diff = min(min_diff, diff)
    
    return min_diff

def solve_apple_division_naive():
    n = int(input())
    weights = list(map(int, input().split()))
    result = apple_division_naive(weights)
    print(result)
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n √ó 2^n) for checking all subsets
**Space Complexity:** O(1) for storing variables

**Why it's inefficient:**
- O(n √ó 2^n) time complexity grows exponentially
- Not suitable for competitive programming with n up to 20
- Memory-intensive for large n
- Poor performance with exponential growth

### Approach 2: Optimized Brute Force with Early Termination (Better)

**Key Insights from Optimized Brute Force Solution:**
- Use early termination to skip unnecessary calculations
- More efficient than naive brute force approach
- Standard method for subset problems
- Can handle larger n than naive approach

**Algorithm:**
1. Generate all possible bitmasks from 0 to 2^n - 1
2. For each bitmask, calculate group 1 weight
3. Use early termination if group 1 weight > total/2
4. Find minimum difference across valid divisions

**Visual Example:**
```
Optimized brute force: Early termination
For weights = [3, 2, 7, 4, 1], total = 17:

Check bitmasks with early termination:
00000: Group1=0 ‚â§ 8.5, Diff=|0-17|=17
00001: Group1=1 ‚â§ 8.5, Diff=|1-16|=15
...
10000: Group1=3 ‚â§ 8.5, Diff=|3-14|=11
11000: Group1=5 ‚â§ 8.5, Diff=|5-12|=7
11100: Group1=12 > 8.5 ‚Üí Skip (early termination)
```

**Implementation:**
```python
def apple_division_optimized(weights):
    n = len(weights)
    total_sum = sum(weights)
    min_diff = float('inf')
    
    for mask in range(1 << n):
        group1_sum = 0
        for i in range(n):
            if mask & (1 << i):
                group1_sum += weights[i]
        
        # Early termination: if group1 is already too heavy
        if group1_sum > total_sum // 2:
            continue
            
        diff = abs(total_sum - 2 * group1_sum)
        min_diff = min(min_diff, diff)
    
    return min_diff

def solve_apple_division_optimized():
    n = int(input())
    weights = list(map(int, input().split()))
    result = apple_division_optimized(weights)
    print(result)
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n √ó 2^n) for checking all subsets
**Space Complexity:** O(1) for storing variables

**Why it's better:**
- Uses early termination to skip about half the combinations
- More efficient than naive brute force
- Suitable for competitive programming
- Efficient for most practical cases

### Approach 3: Mathematical Optimization with Symmetry (Optimal)

**Key Insights from Mathematical Optimization Solution:**
- Use mathematical properties to reduce search space
- Most efficient approach for subset problems
- Standard method in competitive programming
- Can handle the maximum constraint efficiently

**Algorithm:**
1. Use mathematical properties to reduce search space
2. Leverage symmetry to avoid duplicate calculations
3. Use optimized bitmasking with mathematical insights
4. Apply mathematical optimization for optimal solution

**Visual Example:**
```
Mathematical optimization: Symmetry reduction
For weights = [3, 2, 7, 4, 1], total = 17:

Key insight: If mask represents Group1, then ~mask represents Group2
We only need to check masks where Group1 ‚â§ total/2

Symmetric pairs:
00001 ‚Üî 11110: Same difference
00010 ‚Üî 11101: Same difference
00011 ‚Üî 11100: Same difference
...
Only check first half of bitmasks!
```

**Implementation:**
```python
def apple_division_mathematical(weights):
    n = len(weights)
    total_sum = sum(weights)
    min_diff = float('inf')
    
    # Only check first half due to symmetry
    for mask in range(1 << (n - 1)):
        group1_sum = 0
        for i in range(n):
            if mask & (1 << i):
                group1_sum += weights[i]
        
        # Calculate difference
        diff = abs(total_sum - 2 * group1_sum)
        min_diff = min(min_diff, diff)
    
    return min_diff

def solve_apple_division():
    n = int(input())
    weights = list(map(int, input().split()))
    result = apple_division_mathematical(weights)
    print(result)

# Main execution
if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve_apple_division()
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n √ó 2^(n-1)) for checking half the subsets
**Space Complexity:** O(1) for storing variables

**Why it's optimal:**
- O(n √ó 2^(n-1)) time complexity is optimal for this problem
- Uses mathematical symmetry to reduce search space by half
- Most efficient approach for competitive programming
- Standard method for subset optimization
