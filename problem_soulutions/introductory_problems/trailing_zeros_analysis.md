## Problem Description

**Problem**: Calculate the number of trailing zeros in n! (n factorial).

**Input**: An integer n (1 ‚â§ n ‚â§ 10‚Åπ)

**Output**: The number of trailing zeros in n!.

**Constraints**:
- 1 ‚â§ n ‚â§ 10‚Åπ
- Trailing zeros come from factors of 10 = 2 √ó 5
- In factorial, there are always more factors of 2 than 5
- Need to count factors of 5 efficiently
- Cannot compute n! directly for large n

**Example**:
```
Input: 20

Output: 4

Explanation: 20! = 2432902008176640000 has 4 trailing zeros.
```

## Visual Example

### Input and Factorial Calculation
```
Input: n = 20

20! = 20 √ó 19 √ó 18 √ó ... √ó 2 √ó 1
20! = 2432902008176640000
Trailing zeros: 4
```

### Factor Analysis
```
Numbers 1 to 20:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

Factors of 5:
- 5: 1 factor of 5
- 10: 1 factor of 5
- 15: 1 factor of 5
- 20: 1 factor of 5

Total factors of 5: 4
```

### Mathematical Formula
```
For n = 20:
- Count multiples of 5: 20/5 = 4
- Count multiples of 25: 20/25 = 0
- Count multiples of 125: 20/125 = 0
- Total trailing zeros = 4 + 0 + 0 = 4
```

### Key Insight

1. Using mathematical properties of factorial
2. Counting factors of 5 instead of computing factorial
3. Using logarithmic time complexity
4. Time complexity: O(log n) for mathematical approach
5. Space complexity: O(1) for constant variables

## üîç Solution Analysis: From Brute Force to Optimal

### Approach 1: Brute Force Factorial Calculation (Inefficient)

**Key Insights from Brute Force Solution:**
- Calculate n! directly and count trailing zeros
- Simple but computationally expensive approach
- Not suitable for large n
- Straightforward implementation but poor performance

**Algorithm:**
1. Calculate n! by multiplying all numbers from 1 to n
2. Count trailing zeros by repeatedly dividing by 10
3. Handle large numbers with integer overflow
4. Return the count of trailing zeros

**Visual Example:**
```
Brute force: Calculate factorial directly
For n = 20:
- Calculate 20! = 2432902008176640000
- Count trailing zeros: 0000 ‚Üí 4 zeros
```

**Implementation:**
```python
def trailing_zeros_brute_force(n):
    # Calculate factorial
    factorial = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        factorial *= i
    
    # Count trailing zeros
    count = 0
    while factorial % 10 == 0:
        count += 1
        factorial //= 10
    
    return count

def solve_trailing_zeros_brute_force():
    n = int(input())
    result = trailing_zeros_brute_force(n)
    print(result)
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n) for calculating factorial
**Space Complexity:** O(log n!) for storing factorial

**Why it's inefficient:**
- O(n) time complexity is too slow for large n
- Not suitable for competitive programming with n up to 10‚Åπ
- Inefficient for large inputs
- Poor performance with factorial growth

### Approach 2: Mathematical Analysis with Factor Counting (Better)

**Key Insights from Mathematical Solution:**
- Use mathematical properties of factorial
- Much more efficient than brute force approach
- Standard method for trailing zero problems
- Can handle larger n than brute force

**Algorithm:**
1. Understand that trailing zeros come from factors of 10 = 2 √ó 5
2. Count factors of 5 (since 2s are more abundant)
3. Count multiples of 5, 25, 125, etc.
4. Sum all contributions

**Visual Example:**
```
Mathematical approach: Count factors of 5
For n = 20:
- Count multiples of 5: 20/5 = 4
- Count multiples of 25: 20/25 = 0
- Count multiples of 125: 20/125 = 0
- Total trailing zeros = 4 + 0 + 0 = 4
```

**Implementation:**
```python
def trailing_zeros_mathematical(n):
    # Count factors of 5 (since 2s are more abundant)
    count = 0
    power = 5
    
    while power <= n:
        count += n // power
        power *= 5
    
    return count

def solve_trailing_zeros_mathematical():
    n = int(input())
    result = trailing_zeros_mathematical(n)
    print(result)
```

**Time Complexity:** O(log n) for mathematical calculation
**Space Complexity:** O(1) for storing variables

**Why it's better:**
- O(log n) time complexity is much better than O(n)
- Uses mathematical properties for efficient solution
- Suitable for competitive programming
- Efficient for most practical cases

### Approach 3: Optimized Mathematical Formula (Optimal)

**Key Insights from Optimized Mathematical Solution:**
- Use optimized mathematical formulas for efficiency
- Most efficient approach for trailing zero problems
- Standard method in competitive programming
- Can handle the maximum constraint efficiently

**Algorithm:**
1. Use optimized mathematical formulas
2. Apply efficient factor counting
3. Handle edge cases efficiently
4. Return the optimal solution

**Visual Example:**
```
Optimized mathematical: Use efficient formulas
For n = 20:
- Count factors of 5: 20/5 + 20/25 + 20/125 + ... = 4
- Result = 4
```

**Implementation:**
```python
def trailing_zeros_optimized(n):
    # Count factors of 5
    count = 0
    power = 5
    
    while power <= n:
        count += n // power
        power *= 5
    
    return count

def solve_trailing_zeros():
    n = int(input())
    result = trailing_zeros_optimized(n)
    print(result)

# Main execution
if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve_trailing_zeros()
```

**Time Complexity:** O(log n) for optimized mathematical calculation
**Space Complexity:** O(1) for storing variables

**Why it's optimal:**
- O(log n) time complexity is optimal for this problem
- Uses optimized mathematical formulas
- Most efficient approach for competitive programming
- Standard method for trailing zero calculation optimization
