## Problem Description

**Problem**: Count for k=1,2,‚Ä¶,n the number of ways two knights can be placed on a k√ók chessboard so that they do not attack each other.

**Input**: An integer n (1 ‚â§ n ‚â§ 10000)

- Two knights cannot be placed on the same square
- Count all valid non-attacking placements

550
1056
1848
```

8 possible moves: (2,1), (2,-1), (-2,1), (-2,-1), (1,2), (1,-2), (-1,2), (-1,-2)
```

### Counting Process
```
For 3√ó3 board:
Total ways to place 2 knights: C(9,2) = 36

Attacking positions:
- Knight at (0,0) can attack (1,2) and (2,1)
- Knight at (0,1) can attack (1,3) and (2,0) - but (1,3) is out of bounds
- Knight at (0,2) can attack (1,0) and (2,3) - but (2,3) is out of bounds
- ... (count all valid attacking positions)

Valid ways = Total ways - Attacking ways = 36 - 8 = 28
```

### Key Insight
The solution works by:
1. Using combinatorial counting for total placements
2. Calculating attacking positions systematically
3. Using mathematical formulas for efficiency
4. Time complexity: O(n¬≤) for mathematical approach
5. Space complexity: O(1) for constant variables

## üîç Solution Analysis: From Brute Force to Optimal

### Approach 1: Brute Force Enumeration (Inefficient)

**Key Insights from Brute Force Solution:**
- Try all possible knight placements and check for conflicts
- Simple but computationally expensive approach
- Not suitable for large boards
- Straightforward implementation but poor performance

**Algorithm:**
1. Try all possible positions for two knights
2. For each placement, check if knights attack each other
3. Count all valid non-attacking placements
4. Handle edge cases correctly

**Visual Example:**
```
Brute force: Try all knight placements
For 3√ó3 board:
- Try: Knight1 at (0,0), Knight2 at (0,1) ‚Üí Check if they attack
- Try: Knight1 at (0,0), Knight2 at (0,2) ‚Üí Check if they attack
- Try: Knight1 at (0,0), Knight2 at (1,0) ‚Üí Check if they attack
- Try all possible combinations
```

**Implementation:**
```python
def two_knights_brute_force(n):
    def can_attack(pos1, pos2):
        x1, y1 = pos1
        x2, y2 = pos2
        dx = abs(x1 - x2)
        dy = abs(y1 - y2)
        return (dx == 1 and dy == 2) or (dx == 2 and dy == 1)
    
    def count_ways(k):
        if k < 2:
            return 0
        
        total_positions = k * k
        ways = 0
        
        for i in range(total_positions):
            for j in range(i + 1, total_positions):
                pos1 = (i // k, i % k)
                pos2 = (j // k, j % k)
                if not can_attack(pos1, pos2):
                    ways += 1
        
        return ways
    
    results = []
    for k in range(1, n + 1):
        results.append(count_ways(k))
    
    return results

def solve_two_knights_brute_force():
    n = int(input())
    results = two_knights_brute_force(n)
    for result in results:
        print(result)
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n‚Åµ) for trying all possible placements
**Space Complexity:** O(1) for storing variables

**Why it's inefficient:**
- O(n‚Åµ) time complexity is too slow for large n
- Not suitable for competitive programming with n up to 10000
- Inefficient for large inputs
- Poor performance with polynomial growth

### Approach 2: Mathematical Counting with Systematic Attack Calculation (Better)

**Key Insights from Mathematical Solution:**
- Use combinatorial formulas for total placements
- Calculate attacking positions systematically
- Much more efficient than brute force approach
- Standard method for chess piece counting problems

**Algorithm:**
1. Calculate total ways using combination formula C(k¬≤, 2)
2. Count attacking positions by checking all knight moves
3. Subtract attacking ways from total ways
4. Handle edge cases correctly

**Visual Example:**
```
Mathematical approach: Use formulas
For 3√ó3 board:
- Total ways: C(9,2) = 36
- Attacking ways: Count all valid knight attack positions
- Valid ways: 36 - 8 = 28
```

**Implementation:**
```python
def two_knights_mathematical(n):
    def count_ways(k):
        if k < 2:
            return 0
        
        # Total ways to place two knights
        total_ways = (k * k) * (k * k - 1) // 2
        
        # Ways where knights attack each other
        attacking_ways = 0
        
        # Count attacking positions
        for i in range(k):
            for j in range(k):
                # Check all 8 possible knight moves
                moves = [
                    (i-2, j-1), (i-2, j+1),
                    (i-1, j-2), (i-1, j+2),
                    (i+1, j-2), (i+1, j+2),
                    (i+2, j-1), (i+2, j+1)
                ]
                
                for ni, nj in moves:
                    if 0 <= ni < k and 0 <= nj < k:
                        attacking_ways += 1
        
        # Each attacking pair is counted twice, so divide by 2
        attacking_ways //= 2
        
        return total_ways - attacking_ways
    
    results = []
    for k in range(1, n + 1):
        results.append(count_ways(k))
    
    return results

def solve_two_knights_mathematical():
    n = int(input())
    results = two_knights_mathematical(n)
    for result in results:
        print(result)
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n¬≥) for mathematical calculation
**Space Complexity:** O(1) for storing variables

**Why it's better:**
- O(n¬≥) time complexity is much better than O(n‚Åµ)
- Uses mathematical formulas for efficient solution
- Suitable for competitive programming
- Efficient for most practical cases

### Approach 3: Optimized Mathematical Formula (Optimal)

**Key Insights from Optimized Mathematical Solution:**
- Use optimized mathematical formulas for efficiency
- Most efficient approach for knight counting problems
- Standard method in competitive programming
- Can handle the maximum constraint efficiently

**Algorithm:**
1. Use optimized mathematical formulas
2. Apply efficient attack position counting
3. Handle edge cases efficiently
4. Return the optimal solution

**Visual Example:**
```
Optimized mathematical: Use efficient formulas
For k√ók board:
- Total ways: C(k¬≤, 2) = k¬≤ √ó (k¬≤-1) / 2
- Attacking ways: 4 √ó (k-1) √ó (k-2) for k ‚â• 3
- Valid ways: Total ways - Attacking ways
```

**Implementation:**
```python
def two_knights_optimized(n):
    def count_ways(k):
        if k < 2:
            return 0
        
        # Total ways to place two knights
        total_ways = (k * k) * (k * k - 1) // 2
        
        # Optimized calculation of attacking ways
        if k < 3:
            attacking_ways = 0
        else:
            # For k√ók board, attacking ways = 4 √ó (k-1) √ó (k-2)
            attacking_ways = 4 * (k - 1) * (k - 2)
        
        return total_ways - attacking_ways
    
    results = []
    for k in range(1, n + 1):
        results.append(count_ways(k))
    
    return results

def solve_two_knights():
    n = int(input())
    results = two_knights_optimized(n)
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Main execution
if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve_two_knights()
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n) for optimized mathematical calculation
**Space Complexity:** O(1) for storing variables

**Why it's optimal:**

- Uses optimized mathematical formulas
- Most efficient approach for competitive programming
- Standard method for knight counting optimization
