# CSES Repetitions - Problem Analysis

## Problem Statement
You are given a DNA sequence consisting of characters A, C, G, and T.

Your task is to find the longest repetition in the sequence. This is a maximum-length substring containing only one type of character.

### Input
The only input line contains a string of n characters.

### Output
Print one integer: the length of the longest repetition.

### Constraints
- 1 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 10^6

### Example
```
Input:
ATTCGGGA

Output:
3
```

## Solution Progression

### Approach 1: Brute Force - O(nÂ³)
**Description**: Try all possible substrings and check if they contain only one character.

```python
def repetitions_brute_force(sequence):
    n = len(sequence)
    max_length = 0
    
    for start in range(n):
        for end in range(start, n):
            # Check if substring contains only one character
            substring = sequence[start:end + 1]
            if len(set(substring)) == 1:
                max_length = max(max_length, len(substring))
    
    return max_length
```

**Why this is inefficient**: We're checking all possible substrings and for each one, we're checking if all characters are the same. This leads to O(nÂ³) complexity.

### Improvement 1: Sliding Window - O(nÂ²)
**Description**: Use sliding window to find consecutive same characters.

```python
def repetitions_sliding_window(sequence):
    n = len(sequence)
    max_length = 0
    
    for start in range(n):
        current_char = sequence[start]
        current_length = 0
        
        for end in range(start, n):
            if sequence[end] == current_char:
                current_length += 1
            else:
                break
        
        max_length = max(max_length, current_length)
    
    return max_length
```

**Why this improvement works**: Instead of checking each substring separately, we use a sliding window approach. For each starting position, we expand the window until we encounter a different character.

### Improvement 2: Single Pass - O(n)
**Description**: Scan the sequence once and count consecutive same characters.

```python
def repetitions_single_pass(sequence):
    n = len(sequence)
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    
    max_length = 1
    current_length = 1
    
    for i in range(1, n):
        if sequence[i] == sequence[i - 1]:
            current_length += 1
        else:
            max_length = max(max_length, current_length)
            current_length = 1
    
    # Don't forget the last group
    max_length = max(max_length, current_length)
    
    return max_length
```

**Why this improvement works**: We scan the sequence once and keep track of the current length of consecutive same characters. When we encounter a different character, we update the maximum length and reset the current length.

### Alternative: Using Groupby - O(n)
**Description**: Use itertools.groupby to group consecutive same characters.

```python
from itertools import groupby

def repetitions_groupby(sequence):
    max_length = 0
    
    for char, group in groupby(sequence):
        max_length = max(max_length, len(list(group)))
    
    return max_length
```

**Why this works**: The groupby function groups consecutive same elements together, making it easy to find the longest group.

## Final Optimal Solution

```python
sequence = input().strip()

if not sequence:
    print(0)
else:
    max_length = 1
    current_length = 1
    
    for i in range(1, len(sequence)):
        if sequence[i] == sequence[i - 1]:
            current_length += 1
        else:
            max_length = max(max_length, current_length)
            current_length = 1
    
    # Don't forget the last group
    max_length = max(max_length, current_length)
    
    print(max_length)
```

## Notable Techniques

### 1. **Single Pass Pattern**
```python

current_length = 1
max_length = 1
for i in range(1, n):
    if condition:
        current_length += 1
    else:
        max_length = max(max_length, current_length)
        current_length = 1
max_length = max(max_length, current_length)
```

### 2. **Sliding Window Pattern**
```python
# Expand window until condition is violated
for start in range(n):
    current_length = 0
    for end in range(start, n):
        if condition:
            current_length += 1
        else:
            break
    max_length = max(max_length, current_length)
```

### 3. **Groupby Pattern**
```python
# Group consecutive same elements
from itertools import groupby
for char, group in groupby(sequence):
    length = len(list(group))
    # Process group
```

## Edge Cases to Remember

1. **Empty string**: Return 0
2. **Single character**: Return 1
3. **All same characters**: Return length of string
4. **No repetitions**: Return 1 (each character is a repetition of length 1)
5. **Large strings**: Handle efficiently with single pass

## Problem-Solving Framework

1. **Identify pattern nature**: This is about finding consecutive same elements
2. **Consider single pass**: Scan once and maintain state
3. **Handle edge cases**: Empty string, single character, etc.
4. **Optimize the approach**: Use single pass for efficiency
5. **Verify correctness**: Test with examples
