## 📋 Problem Description

There are n machines in a factory. Each machine i takes a[i] seconds to produce one product. You need to produce t products using these machines.

Find the minimum time needed to produce t products if all machines can work in parallel.

**Input**: 
- First line: two integers n and t (number of machines and products needed)
- Second line: n integers a[1], a[2], ..., a[n] (time for each machine to produce one product)

**Output**: 
- Print one integer: the minimum time needed to produce t products

**Constraints**:
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 2×10⁵
- 1 ≤ t ≤ 10⁹
- 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 10⁹

**Example**:
```
Input:
3 7
3 2 5

Output:
6

Explanation**: 
Machines: [3, 2, 5] seconds per product

In 6 seconds:
- Machine 1: 6 ÷ 3 = 2 products
- Machine 2: 6 ÷ 2 = 3 products  
- Machine 3: 6 ÷ 5 = 1 product
- Total: 2 + 3 + 1 = 6 products

We need 7 products, so we need more time.

In 7 seconds:
- Machine 1: 7 ÷ 3 = 2 products
- Machine 2: 7 ÷ 2 = 3 products
- Machine 3: 7 ÷ 5 = 1 product
- Total: 2 + 3 + 1 = 6 products

Still not enough. Let's try 8 seconds:
- Machine 1: 8 ÷ 3 = 2 products
- Machine 2: 8 ÷ 2 = 4 products
- Machine 3: 8 ÷ 5 = 1 product
- Total: 2 + 4 + 1 = 7 products ✓

Minimum time: 8 seconds
```

## 🔍 Solution Analysis: From Brute Force to Optimal

### Approach 1: Brute Force - Try All Possible Times

**Key Insights from Brute Force Approach**:
- **Exhaustive Search**: Try all possible times from 1 to some maximum
- **Complete Coverage**: Guaranteed to find the correct minimum time
- **Simple Implementation**: Straightforward approach with nested loops
- **Inefficient**: Linear time complexity in the answer

**Key Insight**: For each possible time, calculate how many products can be produced and find the minimum time that produces enough products.

**Algorithm**:
- For each time from 1 to some maximum:
  - Calculate total products produced by all machines
  - If total ≥ target, return this time

**Visual Example**:
```
Machines: [3, 2, 5], Target: 7

Time 1: 1÷3 + 1÷2 + 1÷5 = 0 + 0 + 0 = 0 products ✗
Time 2: 2÷3 + 2÷2 + 2÷5 = 0 + 1 + 0 = 1 product ✗
Time 3: 3÷3 + 3÷2 + 3÷5 = 1 + 1 + 0 = 2 products ✗
Time 4: 4÷3 + 4÷2 + 4÷5 = 1 + 2 + 0 = 3 products ✗
Time 5: 5÷3 + 5÷2 + 5÷5 = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4 products ✗
Time 6: 6÷3 + 6÷2 + 6÷5 = 2 + 3 + 1 = 6 products ✗
Time 7: 7÷3 + 7÷2 + 7÷5 = 2 + 3 + 1 = 6 products ✗
Time 8: 8÷3 + 8÷2 + 8÷5 = 2 + 4 + 1 = 7 products ✓

Minimum time: 8
```

**Implementation**:
```python
def brute_force_factory_machines(machines, target):
    """
    Find minimum time to produce target products using brute force
    
    Args:
        machines: list of machine production times
        target: number of products needed
    
    Returns:
        int: minimum time needed
    """
    time = 1
    
    while True:
        total_products = 0
        for machine_time in machines:
            total_products += time // machine_time
        
        if total_products >= target:
            return time
        
        time += 1

# Example usage
machines = [3, 2, 5]
target = 7
result = brute_force_factory_machines(machines, target)
print(f"Brute force result: {result}")  # Output: 8
```

**Time Complexity**: O(answer × n) - Where answer is the minimum time needed
**Space Complexity**: O(1) - Constant extra space

**Why it's inefficient**: Linear time complexity in the answer makes it slow for large targets.

### Approach 2: Optimized - Use Mathematical Bounds

**Key Insights from Optimized Approach**:
- **Mathematical Bounds**: Use mathematical analysis to find better bounds
- **Efficient Calculation**: Calculate products produced more efficiently
- **Better Complexity**: Achieve O(answer × n) time complexity
- **Memory Trade-off**: Use more memory for better time complexity

**Key Insight**: Use mathematical analysis to find better bounds for the search space.

**Algorithm**:
- Calculate upper bound: target × max(machine_time)
- For each time from 1 to upper bound:
  - Calculate total products produced by all machines
  - If total ≥ target, return this time

**Visual Example**:
```
Machines: [3, 2, 5], Target: 7
Max machine time: 5
Upper bound: 7 × 5 = 35

Search from 1 to 35:
Time 1: 0 + 0 + 0 = 0 products ✗
Time 2: 0 + 1 + 0 = 1 product ✗
...
Time 8: 2 + 4 + 1 = 7 products ✓

Minimum time: 8
```

**Implementation**:
```python
def optimized_factory_machines(machines, target):
    """
    Find minimum time to produce target products using optimized approach
    
    Args:
        machines: list of machine production times
        target: number of products needed
    
    Returns:
        int: minimum time needed
    """
    max_machine_time = max(machines)
    upper_bound = target * max_machine_time
    
    for time in range(1, upper_bound + 1):
        total_products = 0
        for machine_time in machines:
            total_products += time // machine_time
        
        if total_products >= target:
            return time
    
    return upper_bound

# Example usage
machines = [3, 2, 5]
target = 7
result = optimized_factory_machines(machines, target)
print(f"Optimized result: {result}")  # Output: 8
```

**Time Complexity**: O(target × max(machine_time) × n) - Better bounds
**Space Complexity**: O(1) - Constant extra space

**Why it's better**: Better bounds reduce the search space.

### Approach 3: Optimal - Binary Search on Answer

**Key Insights from Optimal Approach**:
- **Binary Search**: Use binary search on the answer space
- **Monotonic Property**: If time T produces enough products, then time T+1 also produces enough
- **Optimal Complexity**: Achieve O(n × log(answer)) time complexity
- **Efficient Implementation**: No need for linear search

**Key Insight**: Use binary search on the answer space since the function is monotonic.

**Algorithm**:
- Binary search on time from 1 to upper bound
- For each mid time, calculate total products produced
- If total ≥ target, search for smaller time
- Otherwise, search for larger time

**Visual Example**:
```
Machines: [3, 2, 5], Target: 7
Search space: [1, 35]

Binary search:
- left=1, right=35, mid=18
  Products: 6+9+3 = 18 ≥ 7 ✓ → search [1, 18]
- left=1, right=18, mid=9
  Products: 3+4+1 = 8 ≥ 7 ✓ → search [1, 9]
- left=1, right=9, mid=5
  Products: 1+2+1 = 4 < 7 ✗ → search [6, 9]
- left=6, right=9, mid=7
  Products: 2+3+1 = 6 < 7 ✗ → search [8, 9]
- left=8, right=9, mid=8
  Products: 2+4+1 = 7 ≥ 7 ✓ → search [8, 8]
- left=8, right=8 → answer = 8
```

**Implementation**:
```python
def optimal_factory_machines(machines, target):
    """
    Find minimum time to produce target products using binary search
    
    Args:
        machines: list of machine production times
        target: number of products needed
    
    Returns:
        int: minimum time needed
    """
    def can_produce_enough(time):
        """Check if we can produce enough products in given time"""
        total_products = 0
        for machine_time in machines:
            total_products += time // machine_time
        return total_products >= target
    
    # Binary search on answer
    left = 1
    right = target * max(machines)
    
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if can_produce_enough(mid):
            right = mid
        else:
            left = mid + 1
    
    return left

# Example usage
machines = [3, 2, 5]
target = 7
result = optimal_factory_machines(machines, target)
print(f"Optimal result: {result}")  # Output: 8
```

**Time Complexity**: O(n × log(answer)) - Binary search on answer
**Space Complexity**: O(1) - Constant extra space

**Why it's optimal**: Achieves the best possible time complexity with binary search optimization.
