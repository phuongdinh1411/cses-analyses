# CSES Factory Machines - Problem Analysis

## Problem Statement
There are n machines and k products. Each machine takes a certain time to produce one product. Find the minimum time needed to produce all k products.

### Input
The first input line has two integers n and k: the number of machines and products.
The second line has n integers t1,t2,…,tn: the time each machine takes to produce one product.

### Output
Print one integer: the minimum time needed to produce all k products.

### Constraints
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5
- 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9
- 1 ≤ ti ≤ 10^9

### Example
```
Input:
3 7
3 2 5

Output:
8
```

## Solution Progression

### Approach 1: Brute Force - O(k * n)
**Description**: Simulate the production process step by step.

```python
def factory_machines_naive(n, k, times):
    # Simulate production
    machine_times = [0] * n  # Current time for each machine
    products_made = 0
    
    while products_made < k:
        # Find machine with minimum current time
        min_machine = 0
        for i in range(1, n):
            if machine_times[i] < machine_times[min_machine]:
                min_machine = i
        
        # Assign product to this machine
        machine_times[min_machine] += times[min_machine]
        products_made += 1
    
    return max(machine_times)
```

**Why this is inefficient**: We need to simulate k products, and for each product we find the minimum machine, leading to O(k * n) time complexity.

### Improvement 1: Binary Search - O(n log(k * max_time))
**Description**: Use binary search to find the minimum time needed.

```python
def factory_machines_optimized(n, k, times):
    def can_produce_k_products(time_limit):
        products = 0
        for t in times:
            products += time_limit // t
            if products >= k:
                return True
        return products >= k
    
    # Binary search for the minimum time
    left = 1
    right = k * max(times)  # Maximum possible time
    
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if can_produce_k_products(mid):
            right = mid
        else:
            left = mid + 1
    
    return left
```

**Why this improvement works**: Instead of simulating the process, we use binary search to find the minimum time. For a given time limit, we can calculate how many products each machine can produce and check if the total is sufficient.

## Final Optimal Solution

```python
n, k = map(int, input().split())
times = list(map(int, input().split()))

def find_minimum_production_time(n, k, times):
    def can_produce_k_products(time_limit):
        products = 0
        for t in times:
            products += time_limit // t
            if products >= k:
                return True
        return products >= k
    
    # Binary search for the minimum time
    left = 1
    right = k * max(times)  # Maximum possible time
    
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if can_produce_k_products(mid):
            right = mid
        else:
            left = mid + 1
    
    return left

result = find_minimum_production_time(n, k, times)
print(result)
```
