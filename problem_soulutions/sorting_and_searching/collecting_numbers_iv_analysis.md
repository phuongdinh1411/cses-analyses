# CSES Collecting Numbers IV - Problem Analysis

## Problem Statement
Given an array of n integers, you want to collect them in increasing order. You can collect a number if you have already collected all numbers smaller than it. Find the minimum number of rounds needed to collect all numbers, and also find the order in which numbers are collected in each round.

### Input
The first input line has an integer n: the size of the array.
The second line has n integers x1,x2,…,xn: the array.

### Output
Print the minimum number of rounds and the collection order for each round.

### Constraints
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5
- 1 ≤ xi ≤ n

### Example
```
Input:
5
4 2 1 5 3

Output:
2
Round 1: 1 2
Round 2: 3 4 5
```

## Solution Progression

### Approach 1: Simulate Collection Process - O(n²)
**Description**: Simulate the collection process and track the order for each round.

```python
def collecting_numbers_iv_naive(n, arr):
    # Create a list of (value, index) pairs
    pairs = [(arr[i], i) for i in range(n)]
    pairs.sort()  # Sort by value
    
    rounds = 0
    collected = set()
    round_orders = []
    
    while len(collected) < n:
        rounds += 1
        current_round = []
        
        for value, index in pairs:
            if index not in collected:
                # Check if we can collect this number
                can_collect = True
                for smaller_value, smaller_index in pairs:
                    if smaller_value < value and smaller_index not in collected:
                        can_collect = False
                        break
                
                if can_collect:
                    current_round.append(value)
                    collected.add(index)
        
        round_orders.append(current_round)
        
        if not current_round:
            break
    
    return rounds, round_orders
```

**Why this is inefficient**: For each round, we need to check all remaining numbers, leading to O(n²) time complexity.

### Improvement 1: Position Tracking with Round Analysis - O(n log n)
**Description**: Track positions and determine collection order for each round efficiently.

```python
def collecting_numbers_iv_optimized(n, arr):
    # Create position array: pos[i] = position of number i in the array
    pos = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        pos[arr[i]] = i
    
    # Determine which round each number belongs to
    round_numbers = [0] * (n + 1)
    current_round = 1
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if i > 1 and pos[i] < pos[i - 1]:
            current_round += 1
        round_numbers[i] = current_round
    
    # Group numbers by round
    rounds = {}
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        round_num = round_numbers[i]
        if round_num not in rounds:
            rounds[round_num] = []
        rounds[round_num].append(i)
    
    return current_round, rounds
```

**Why this improvement works**: We can determine which round each number belongs to using position analysis and then group them accordingly.

## Final Optimal Solution

```python
n = int(input())
arr = list(map(int, input().split()))

def find_minimum_rounds_and_round_orders(n, arr):
    # Create position array: pos[i] = position of number i in the array
    pos = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        pos[arr[i]] = i
    
    # Determine which round each number belongs to
    round_numbers = [0] * (n + 1)
    current_round = 1
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if i > 1 and pos[i] < pos[i - 1]:
            current_round += 1
        round_numbers[i] = current_round
    
    # Group numbers by round
    rounds = {}
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        round_num = round_numbers[i]
        if round_num not in rounds:
            rounds[round_num] = []
        rounds[round_num].append(i)
    
    return current_round, rounds

total_rounds, round_orders = find_minimum_rounds_and_round_orders(n, arr)
print(total_rounds)

for round_num in range(1, total_rounds + 1):
    if round_num in round_orders:
        print(f"Round {round_num}:", *round_orders[round_num])
```
