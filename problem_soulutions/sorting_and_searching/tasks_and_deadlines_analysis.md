# Tasks and Deadlines

## Problem Statement
Given n tasks, each with a duration and deadline, find the maximum profit that can be obtained. The profit for a task is deadline - completion_time, and completion_time is the sum of durations of all tasks completed before it plus its own duration.

### Input
The first input line has an integer n: the number of tasks.
Then there are n lines. Each line has two integers d and x: the duration and deadline of a task.

### Output
Print one integer: the maximum profit.

### Constraints
- 1 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 2â‹…10^5
- 1 â‰¤ d,x â‰¤ 10^9

### Example
```
Input:
3
6 10
8 15
5 12

Output:
17
```

## Solution Progression

### Approach 1: Brute Force - O(n!)
**Description**: Try all possible orderings of tasks.

```python
def tasks_and_deadlines_naive(n, tasks):
    from itertools import permutations
    
    max_profit = 0
    
    for order in permutations(range(n)):
        current_time = 0
        profit = 0
        
        for task_idx in order:
            duration, deadline = tasks[task_idx]
            current_time += duration
            profit += max(0, deadline - current_time)
        
        max_profit = max(max_profit, profit)
    
    return max_profit
```

**Why this is inefficient**: We try all n! possible orderings, leading to factorial time complexity.

### Improvement 1: Greedy by Deadline - O(n log n)
**Description**: Sort tasks by deadline and process them in order.

```python
def tasks_and_deadlines_optimized(n, tasks):
    # Sort tasks by deadline (ascending)
    tasks.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])
    
    current_time = 0
    profit = 0
    
    for duration, deadline in tasks:
        current_time += duration
        profit += max(0, deadline - current_time)
    
    return profit
```

**Why this improvement works**: The optimal strategy is to process tasks in order of increasing deadline. This ensures that we complete tasks with earlier deadlines first, maximizing the profit.

## Final Optimal Solution

```python
n = int(input())
tasks = []
for _ in range(n):
    d, x = map(int, input().split())
    tasks.append((d, x))

def find_maximum_profit(n, tasks):
    # Sort tasks by deadline (ascending)
    tasks.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])
    
    current_time = 0
    profit = 0
    
    for duration, deadline in tasks:
        current_time += duration
        profit += max(0, deadline - current_time)
    
    return profit

result = find_maximum_profit(n, tasks)
print(result)
```

        profit += max(0, deadline - current_time)
    
    return profit
```

### 3. **Greedy Task Processing**
```python
def process_tasks_greedily(tasks):
    # Sort by deadline
    sorted_tasks = sort_by_deadline(tasks)
    
    # Process in order
    return calculate_profit(sorted_tasks)
```

## Problem-Solving Framework

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Variations & Related Questions

### ðŸ”„ **Variations of the Original Problem**

#### **Variation 1: Tasks with Priority and Deadlines**
**Problem**: Tasks have priority levels. Higher priority tasks must be completed first.
```python
def tasks_with_priority_and_deadlines(n, tasks, priorities):
    # tasks[i] = (duration, deadline), priorities[i] = priority level
    task_data = [(tasks[i][0], tasks[i][1], priorities[i], i) for i in range(n)]
    
    # Sort by priority (higher first), then by deadline
    task_data.sort(key=lambda x: (-x[2], x[1]))
    
    current_time = 0
    profit = 0
    
    for duration, deadline, priority, task_id in task_data:
        current_time += duration
        profit += max(0, deadline - current_time)
    
    return profit
```

#### **Variation 2: Tasks with Dependencies**
**Problem**: Some tasks must be completed before others.
```python
def tasks_with_dependencies(n, tasks, dependencies):
    # dependencies[i] = list of tasks that must be completed before task i
    from collections import defaultdict, deque
    
    # Build dependency graph
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    in_degree = [0] * n
    
    for i, deps in enumerate(dependencies):
        for dep in deps:
            graph[dep].append(i)
            in_degree[i] += 1
    
    # Topological sort with profit calculation
    queue = deque()
    completion_time = [0] * n
    profit = 0
    
    # Add tasks with no dependencies
    for i in range(n):
        if in_degree[i] == 0:
            queue.append(i)
    
    while queue:
        task = queue.popleft()
        duration, deadline = tasks[task]
        
        # Calculate completion time
        completion_time[task] = completion_time[task] + duration
        profit += max(0, deadline - completion_time[task])
        
        # Update dependent tasks
        for next_task in graph[task]:
            in_degree[next_task] -= 1
            completion_time[next_task] = max(completion_time[next_task], completion_time[task])
            
            if in_degree[next_task] == 0:
                queue.append(next_task)
    
    return profit if max(in_degree) == 0 else -1
```

#### **Variation 3: Tasks with Resource Constraints**
**Problem**: Limited resources available. Each task requires specific resources.
```python
def tasks_with_resource_constraints(n, tasks, resource_requirements, available_resources):
    # resource_requirements[i] = list of resources needed for task i
    # available_resources = total available resources
    task_data = [(tasks[i][0], tasks[i][1], resource_requirements[i], i) for i in range(n)]
    
    # Sort by deadline
    task_data.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])
    
    current_time = 0
    profit = 0
    used_resources = set()
    
    for duration, deadline, resources, task_id in task_data:
        # Check if we have required resources
        can_execute = True
        for resource in resources:
            if resource in used_resources:
                can_execute = False
                break
        
        if can_execute:
            current_time += duration
            profit += max(0, deadline - current_time)
            
            # Mark resources as used
            for resource in resources:
                used_resources.add(resource)
    
    return profit
```

#### **Variation 4: Tasks with Dynamic Deadlines**
**Problem**: Deadlines can be extended with penalties.
```python
def tasks_with_dynamic_deadlines(n, tasks, extension_costs):
    # extension_costs[i] = cost to extend deadline of task i by 1 unit
    task_data = [(tasks[i][0], tasks[i][1], extension_costs[i], i) for i in range(n)]
    
    # Sort by deadline
    task_data.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])
    
    current_time = 0
    profit = 0
    
    for duration, deadline, extension_cost, task_id in task_data:
        current_time += duration
        
        if current_time > deadline:
            # Calculate optimal extension
            extension_needed = current_time - deadline
            extension_cost_total = extension_needed * extension_cost
            profit += max(0, deadline - current_time) - extension_cost_total
        else:
            profit += max(0, deadline - current_time)
    
    return profit
```

#### **Variation 5: Tasks with Parallel Execution**
**Problem**: Some tasks can be executed in parallel.
```python
def tasks_with_parallel_execution(n, tasks, parallel_groups):
    # parallel_groups[i] = list of tasks that can be executed in parallel with task i
    from collections import defaultdict
    
    # Build parallel execution graph
    parallel_graph = defaultdict(list)
    for i, group in enumerate(parallel_groups):
        for task in group:
            parallel_graph[i].append(task)
            parallel_graph[task].append(i)
    
    # Find connected components (parallel groups)
    visited = [False] * n
    components = []
    
    def dfs(node, component):
        visited[node] = True
        component.append(node)
        for neighbor in parallel_graph[node]:
            if not visited[neighbor]:
                dfs(neighbor, component)
    
    for i in range(n):
        if not visited[i]:
            component = []
            dfs(i, component)
            components.append(component)
    
    # Process each component optimally
    total_profit = 0
    current_time = 0
    
    for component in components:
        # Sort tasks in component by deadline
        component_tasks = [(tasks[i][0], tasks[i][1]) for i in component]
        component_tasks.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])
        
        # Execute tasks in parallel (minimum duration)
        min_duration = min(task[0] for task in component_tasks)
        current_time += min_duration
        
        # Calculate profit
        for duration, deadline in component_tasks:
            total_profit += max(0, deadline - current_time)
    
    return total_profit
```
