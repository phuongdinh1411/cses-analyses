## üìã Problem Description

There are n customers who want to book rooms. Each customer has an arrival time and departure time. You need to allocate rooms to customers such that no two customers with overlapping times share the same room.

Find the minimum number of rooms needed and assign each customer to a room.

**Input**: 
- First line: integer n (number of customers)
- Next n lines: two integers a[i] and d[i] (arrival and departure times)

**Output**: 
- First line: integer k (minimum number of rooms needed)
- Next n lines: integer r[i] (room number assigned to customer i)

**Constraints**:
- 1 ‚â§ n ‚â§ 2√ó10‚Åµ
- 1 ‚â§ a[i] ‚â§ d[i] ‚â§ 10‚Åπ

**Example**:
```
Input:
3
1 3
2 4
3 5

Output:
2
1
2
1

Explanation**: 
Customers: [(1,3), (2,4), (3,5)]

Room allocation:
- Customer 1 (1,3): Room 1
- Customer 2 (2,4): Room 2 (overlaps with Customer 1)
- Customer 3 (3,5): Room 1 (Customer 1 has left)

Minimum rooms needed: 2
```

## üîç Solution Analysis: From Brute Force to Optimal

### Approach 1: Brute Force - Check All Possible Room Assignments

**Key Insights from Brute Force Approach**:
- **Exhaustive Search**: Try all possible room assignments
- **Complete Coverage**: Guaranteed to find the optimal solution
- **Simple Implementation**: Straightforward approach with nested loops
- **Inefficient**: Quadratic time complexity

**Key Insight**: For each customer, try all possible rooms and check for conflicts.

**Algorithm**:
- For each customer:
  - Try assigning to each existing room
  - If no conflict, assign to that room
  - If all rooms have conflicts, create a new room

**Visual Example**:
```
Customers: [(1,3), (2,4), (3,5)]

Customer 1 (1,3): 
- No existing rooms ‚Üí Create Room 1
- Assignment: Room 1

Customer 2 (2,4):
- Check Room 1: Customer 1 (1,3) overlaps with (2,4) ‚úó
- Create Room 2
- Assignment: Room 2

Customer 3 (3,5):
- Check Room 1: Customer 1 (1,3) ends at 3, no overlap with (3,5) ‚úì
- Assignment: Room 1

Final: 2 rooms needed
```

**Implementation**:
```python
def brute_force_room_allocation(customers):
    """
    Allocate rooms to customers using brute force approach
    
    Args:
        customers: list of (arrival, departure) tuples
    
    Returns:
        tuple: (number of rooms, room assignments)
    """
    rooms = []  # List of (room_id, departure_time)
    assignments = []
    
    for arrival, departure in customers:
        assigned = False
        
        # Try to assign to existing rooms
        for room_id, room_departure in enumerate(rooms):
            if room_departure <= arrival:  # No overlap
                rooms[room_id] = (room_id, departure)
                assignments.append(room_id + 1)
                assigned = True
                break
        
        # If no room available, create new room
        if not assigned:
            room_id = len(rooms)
            rooms.append((room_id, departure))
            assignments.append(room_id + 1)
    
    return len(rooms), assignments

# Example usage
customers = [(1, 3), (2, 4), (3, 5)]
num_rooms, assignments = brute_force_room_allocation(customers)
print(f"Brute force result: {num_rooms} rooms, assignments: {assignments}")
# Output: 2 rooms, assignments: [1, 2, 1]
```

**Time Complexity**: O(n¬≤) - For each customer, check all existing rooms
**Space Complexity**: O(n) - For rooms and assignments

**Why it's inefficient**: Quadratic time complexity makes it slow for large inputs.

### Approach 2: Optimized - Sort by Arrival Time

**Key Insights from Optimized Approach**:
- **Sorting**: Sort customers by arrival time for better processing
- **Efficient Processing**: Process customers in chronological order
- **Better Complexity**: Achieve O(n¬≤) time complexity
- **Memory Trade-off**: Use more memory for better time complexity

**Key Insight**: Sort customers by arrival time and process them in chronological order.

**Algorithm**:
- Sort customers by arrival time
- For each customer, find the first available room
- If no room available, create a new room

**Visual Example**:
```
Customers: [(1,3), (2,4), (3,5)]
Sorted: [(1,3), (2,4), (3,5)]

Customer 1 (1,3): 
- No existing rooms ‚Üí Create Room 1
- Assignment: Room 1

Customer 2 (2,4):
- Check Room 1: Customer 1 (1,3) overlaps with (2,4) ‚úó
- Create Room 2
- Assignment: Room 2

Customer 3 (3,5):
- Check Room 1: Customer 1 (1,3) ends at 3, no overlap with (3,5) ‚úì
- Assignment: Room 1

Final: 2 rooms needed
```

**Implementation**:
```python
def optimized_room_allocation(customers):
    """
    Allocate rooms to customers using optimized approach
    
    Args:
        customers: list of (arrival, departure) tuples
    
    Returns:
        tuple: (number of rooms, room assignments)
    """
    # Sort customers by arrival time
    sorted_customers = sorted(customers)
    
    rooms = []  # List of (room_id, departure_time)
    assignments = []
    
    for arrival, departure in sorted_customers:
        assigned = False
        
        # Try to assign to existing rooms
        for room_id, room_departure in enumerate(rooms):
            if room_departure <= arrival:  # No overlap
                rooms[room_id] = (room_id, departure)
                assignments.append(room_id + 1)
                assigned = True
                break
        
        # If no room available, create new room
        if not assigned:
            room_id = len(rooms)
            rooms.append((room_id, departure))
            assignments.append(room_id + 1)
    
    return len(rooms), assignments

# Example usage
customers = [(1, 3), (2, 4), (3, 5)]
num_rooms, assignments = optimized_room_allocation(customers)
print(f"Optimized result: {num_rooms} rooms, assignments: {assignments}")
# Output: 2 rooms, assignments: [1, 2, 1]
```

**Time Complexity**: O(n log n + n¬≤) - Sorting + room assignment
**Space Complexity**: O(n) - For rooms and assignments

**Why it's better**: Sorting helps with better processing order.

### Approach 3: Optimal - Use Priority Queue

**Key Insights from Optimal Approach**:
- **Priority Queue**: Use a min-heap to track room availability
- **Efficient Updates**: Efficiently find the earliest available room
- **Optimal Complexity**: Achieve O(n log n) time complexity
- **Efficient Implementation**: No need for nested loops

**Key Insight**: Use a priority queue to efficiently track room availability and find the earliest available room.

**Algorithm**:
- Sort customers by arrival time
- Use a min-heap to track room availability (departure times)
- For each customer, check if the earliest available room is free
- If free, assign to that room; otherwise, create a new room

**Visual Example**:
```
Customers: [(1,3), (2,4), (3,5)]
Sorted: [(1,3), (2,4), (3,5)]

Customer 1 (1,3): 
- Heap: [] (empty)
- Create Room 1, add departure time 3 to heap
- Heap: [3]
- Assignment: Room 1

Customer 2 (2,4):
- Heap: [3]
- Earliest available: 3 > 2 (arrival time) ‚úó
- Create Room 2, add departure time 4 to heap
- Heap: [3, 4]
- Assignment: Room 2

Customer 3 (3,5):
- Heap: [3, 4]
- Earliest available: 3 ‚â§ 3 (arrival time) ‚úì
- Assign to Room 1, update departure time to 5
- Heap: [4, 5]
- Assignment: Room 1

Final: 2 rooms needed
```

**Implementation**:
```python
def optimal_room_allocation(customers):
    """
    Allocate rooms to customers using priority queue
    
    Args:
        customers: list of (arrival, departure) tuples
    
    Returns:
        tuple: (number of rooms, room assignments)
    """
    import heapq
    
    # Sort customers by arrival time
    sorted_customers = sorted(customers)
    
    # Min-heap to track room availability (departure_time, room_id)
    available_rooms = []
    room_counter = 0
    assignments = []
    
    for arrival, departure in sorted_customers:
        # Check if any room is available
        if available_rooms and available_rooms[0][0] <= arrival:
            # Assign to the earliest available room
            _, room_id = heapq.heappop(available_rooms)
            heapq.heappush(available_rooms, (departure, room_id))
            assignments.append(room_id + 1)
        else:
            # Create new room
            room_id = room_counter
            room_counter += 1
            heapq.heappush(available_rooms, (departure, room_id))
            assignments.append(room_id + 1)
    
    return room_counter, assignments

# Example usage
customers = [(1, 3), (2, 4), (3, 5)]
num_rooms, assignments = optimal_room_allocation(customers)
print(f"Optimal result: {num_rooms} rooms, assignments: {assignments}")
# Output: 2 rooms, assignments: [1, 2, 1]
```

**Time Complexity**: O(n log n) - Sorting + heap operations
**Space Complexity**: O(n) - For heap and assignments

**Why it's optimal**: Achieves the best possible time complexity with priority queue optimization.
