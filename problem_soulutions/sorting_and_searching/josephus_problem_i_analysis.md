## üìã Problem Description

There are n people sitting in a circle. We start counting from person 1 and eliminate every second person (person 2, 4, 6, ...) until only one person remains.

Find the position of the last remaining person.

**Input**: 
- One integer n (number of people)

**Output**: 
- Print one integer: the position of the last remaining person

**Constraints**:
- 1 ‚â§ n ‚â§ 10‚Å∂

**Example**:
```
Input:
7

Output:
7

Explanation**: 
Circle: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

Round 1: Eliminate 2, 4, 6 ‚Üí Remaining: [1, 3, 5, 7]
Round 2: Eliminate 3, 7 ‚Üí Remaining: [1, 5]
Round 3: Eliminate 5 ‚Üí Remaining: [1]

Last remaining: Person 1

Wait, let me recalculate:
Circle: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

Round 1: Start from 1, eliminate 2, 4, 6 ‚Üí Remaining: [1, 3, 5, 7]
Round 2: Start from 1, eliminate 3, 7 ‚Üí Remaining: [1, 5]
Round 3: Start from 1, eliminate 5 ‚Üí Remaining: [1]

Last remaining: Person 1

Actually, let me trace more carefully:
Circle: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

Round 1: Start from 1, count 1,2 ‚Üí eliminate 2
         Start from 3, count 3,4 ‚Üí eliminate 4
         Start from 5, count 5,6 ‚Üí eliminate 6
         Start from 7, count 7,1 ‚Üí eliminate 1
         Remaining: [3, 5, 7]

Round 2: Start from 3, count 3,5 ‚Üí eliminate 5
         Start from 7, count 7,3 ‚Üí eliminate 3
         Remaining: [7]

Last remaining: Person 7
```
