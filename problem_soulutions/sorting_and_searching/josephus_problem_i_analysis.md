# Josephus Problem I

## Problem Description

**Problem**: There are n people numbered from 1 to n standing in a circle. Starting from person 1, we eliminate every second person until only one person remains. Find the position of the last remaining person.

**Input**: 
- First line: n (number of people)

**Output**: Position of the last remaining person.

**Example**:
```
Input:
7

Output:
7

Explanation: 
Initial circle: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
Round 1: Eliminate 2, 4, 6 → [1, 3, 5, 7]
Round 2: Eliminate 3, 7 → [1, 5]
Round 3: Eliminate 5 → [1]
Last remaining: 1

Wait, let me trace this more carefully...
Starting from 1, eliminate every second person:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
1, _, 3, _, 5, _, 7  (eliminate 2, 4, 6)
1, _, _, _, 5, _, _  (eliminate 3, 7)
1, _, _, _, _, _, _  (eliminate 5)
Last remaining: 1

But the example shows 7, so let me check the problem again...
Actually, the problem says "eliminate every second person" starting from 1.
So we eliminate 2, then 4, then 6, etc.
Let me trace again:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
1, _, 3, _, 5, _, 7  (eliminate 2, 4, 6)
1, _, _, _, 5, _, _  (eliminate 3, 7)
1, _, _, _, _, _, _  (eliminate 5)
Last remaining: 1

The example shows 7, so there might be a different interpretation...
```

## 📊 Visual Example

### Initial Circle Setup
```
People: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
Index:   0  1  2  3  4  5  6
n = 7 people
```

### Elimination Process (Correct Interpretation)
```
Round 1: Eliminate every second person starting from 1
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Current: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]     │
│ Start from 1, eliminate 2, 4, 6     │
│ Remaining: [1, 3, 5, 7]            │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

Round 2: Continue from next person (3)
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Current: [1, 3, 5, 7]              │
│ Start from 3, eliminate 3, 7        │
│ Remaining: [1, 5]                  │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

Round 3: Continue from next person (5)
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Current: [1, 5]                    │
│ Start from 5, eliminate 5           │
│ Remaining: [1]                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

Final result: Person 1 survives
```

### Step-by-Step Visualization
```
Initial: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
         ↑
         Start here

Round 1: 1 _ 3 _ 5 _ 7
         ↑     ↑     ↑
         Keep  Keep  Keep

Round 2: 1 _ _ _ 5 _ _
         ↑       ↑
         Keep    Keep

Round 3: 1 _ _ _ _ _ _
         ↑
         Keep (last remaining)
```

### Mathematical Formula
```
For n people, the last remaining person is:
J(n) = 2 * (n - 2^⌊log₂(n)⌋) + 1

For n = 7:
- 2^⌊log₂(7)⌋ = 2^2 = 4
- J(7) = 2 * (7 - 4) + 1 = 2 * 3 + 1 = 7

Note: The formula gives 7, but simulation gives 1.
This suggests the problem might have a different interpretation.

## 🎯 Solution Progression

### Step 1: Understanding the Problem
**What are we trying to do?**
- n people in a circle numbered 1 to n
- Start from person 1
- Eliminate every second person
- Find the last remaining person

**Key Observations:**
- This is the classic Josephus problem
- Has a mathematical closed-form solution
- Can be solved efficiently with bit manipulation
- Pattern depends on powers of 2

### Step 2: Brute Force Approach
**Idea**: Simulate the elimination process step by step.

```python
def josephus_problem_brute_force(n):
    people = list(range(1, n + 1))
    index = 0
    
    while len(people) > 1:
        # Eliminate every second person
        index = (index + 1) % len(people)
        people.pop(index)
    
    return people[0]
```

**Why this works:**
- Simulates actual elimination process
- Easy to understand and implement
- Guarantees correct answer
- O(n²) time complexity

### Step 3: Mathematical Formula Optimization
**Idea**: Use the mathematical formula for the Josephus problem.

```python
def josephus_problem_mathematical(n):
    # Find the largest power of 2 less than or equal to n
    l = 1
    while l * 2 <= n:
        l *= 2
    
    # The answer is 2 * (n - l) + 1
    return 2 * (n - l) + 1
```

**Why this is better:**
- O(log n) time complexity
- Uses mathematical insight
- Much more efficient
- Handles large n

### Step 4: Complete Solution
**Putting it all together:**

```python
def solve_josephus_problem_i():
    n = int(input())
    
    # Find the largest power of 2 less than or equal to n
    l = 1
    while l * 2 <= n:
        l *= 2
    
    # The answer is 2 * (n - l) + 1
    result = 2 * (n - l) + 1
    
    print(result)

# Main execution
if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve_josephus_problem_i()
```

**Why this works:**
- Optimal mathematical approach
- Handles all edge cases
- Efficient implementation
- Clear and readable code

### Step 5: Testing Our Solution
**Let's verify with examples:**

```python
def test_solution():
    test_cases = [
        (7, 7),
        (1, 1),
        (2, 1),
        (3, 3),
        (4, 1),
        (5, 3),
        (6, 5),
        (8, 1),
    ]
    
    for n, expected in test_cases:
        result = solve_test(n)
        print(f"n={n}")
        print(f"Expected: {expected}, Got: {result}")
        print(f"{'✓ PASS' if result == expected else '✗ FAIL'}")
        print()

def solve_test(n):
    l = 1
    while l * 2 <= n:
        l *= 2
    return 2 * (n - l) + 1

test_solution()
```

## 🔧 Implementation Details

## 🎯 Problem Variations

### Variation 1: Josephus Problem II
**Problem**: Eliminate every k-th person instead of every second person.

```python
def josephus_problem_ii(n, k):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    
    # Recursive formula: J(n,k) = (J(n-1,k) + k) % n
    # Base case: J(1,k) = 0 (0-indexed)
    result = 0
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result = (result + k) % i
    
    return result + 1  # Convert to 1-indexed
```

### Variation 2: Josephus Problem with Skip
**Problem**: Skip m people before eliminating the next person.

```python
def josephus_problem_with_skip(n, skip):
    people = list(range(1, n + 1))
    index = 0
    
    while len(people) > 1:
        # Skip m people, then eliminate the next
        index = (index + skip) % len(people)
        people.pop(index)
    
    return people[0]
```

### Variation 3: Josephus Problem with Direction Change
**Problem**: Change direction after each elimination.

```python
def josephus_problem_direction_change(n):
    people = list(range(1, n + 1))
    index = 0
    direction = 1  # 1 for clockwise, -1 for counterclockwise
    
    while len(people) > 1:
        # Move in current direction
        index = (index + direction) % len(people)
        people.pop(index)
        
        # Change direction
        direction *= -1
    
    return people[0]
```

### Variation 4: Josephus Problem with Multiple Survivors
**Problem**: Find the last m survivors instead of just one.

```python
def josephus_problem_multiple_survivors(n, m):
    people = list(range(1, n + 1))
    index = 0
    
    while len(people) > m:
        # Eliminate every second person
        index = (index + 1) % len(people)
        people.pop(index)
    
    return people
```

### Variation 5: Josephus Problem with Weights
**Problem**: Each person has a weight, eliminate person with minimum weight.

```python
def josephus_problem_with_weights(n, weights):
    people = [(i + 1, weights[i]) for i in range(n)]
    
    while len(people) > 1:
        # Find person with minimum weight
        min_idx = 0
        for i in range(1, len(people)):
            if people[i][1] < people[min_idx][1]:
                min_idx = i
        
        # Eliminate this person
        people.pop(min_idx)
    
    return people[0][0]
```
