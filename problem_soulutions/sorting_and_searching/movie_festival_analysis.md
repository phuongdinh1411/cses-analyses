# Movie Festival

## üìã Problem Information

### üéØ **Learning Objectives**
By the end of this problem, you should be able to:
- Understand the interval scheduling problem and its applications
- Apply greedy algorithms for optimization problems
- Implement efficient sorting and selection strategies
- Optimize interval selection algorithms for large inputs
- Handle edge cases in scheduling problems (overlapping intervals, single intervals)

### üìö **Prerequisites**
Before attempting this problem, ensure you understand:
- **Algorithm Knowledge**: Greedy algorithms, sorting, interval scheduling, optimization
- **Data Structures**: Arrays, sorted arrays, interval data structures
- **Mathematical Concepts**: Optimization, greedy choice property, interval theory
- **Programming Skills**: Sorting implementation, greedy algorithms, interval manipulation
- **Related Problems**: Restaurant Customers (interval problems), Tasks and Deadlines (scheduling), Room Allocation (resource allocation)

## üìã Problem Description

Given n movies with start and end times, find the maximum number of movies you can watch without overlapping. You can only watch one movie at a time.

This is a classic interval scheduling problem that can be solved efficiently using a greedy algorithm based on end times.

**Input**: 
- First line: integer n (number of movies)
- Next n lines: two integers a and b (start and end time of each movie)

**Output**: 
- Print one integer: the maximum number of movies you can watch

**Constraints**:
- 1 ‚â§ n ‚â§ 2√ó10‚Åµ
- 1 ‚â§ a ‚â§ b ‚â§ 10‚Åπ

**Example**:
```
Input:
3
3 5
4 9
5 8

Output:
2

Explanation**: 
You can watch movies 1 and 3:
- Movie 1: 3-5
- Movie 3: 5-8 (starts exactly when movie 1 ends)

Movie 2 (4-9) overlaps with both, so you can't watch it.
Maximum movies: 2
```

## üîç Solution Analysis: From Brute Force to Optimal

### Approach 1: Brute Force - Try All Possible Combinations

**Key Insights from Brute Force Approach**:
- **Exhaustive Search**: Try all possible combinations of movies
- **Overlap Checking**: For each combination, check if any movies overlap
- **Complete Coverage**: Guaranteed to find the optimal solution
- **Simple Implementation**: Straightforward recursive approach

**Key Insight**: Generate all possible subsets of movies and find the largest subset with no overlapping movies.

**Algorithm**:
- Generate all possible subsets of movies
- For each subset, check if all movies are non-overlapping
- Keep track of the largest valid subset

**Visual Example**:
```
Movies: [(3,5), (4,9), (5,8)]

All possible subsets:
1. {} ‚Üí 0 movies
2. {(3,5)} ‚Üí 1 movie ‚úì
3. {(4,9)} ‚Üí 1 movie ‚úì
4. {(5,8)} ‚Üí 1 movie ‚úì
5. {(3,5), (4,9)} ‚Üí (3,5) overlaps with (4,9) ‚úó
6. {(3,5), (5,8)} ‚Üí No overlap ‚úì (2 movies)
7. {(4,9), (5,8)} ‚Üí (4,9) overlaps with (5,8) ‚úó
8. {(3,5), (4,9), (5,8)} ‚Üí Multiple overlaps ‚úó

Maximum: 2 movies
```

**Implementation**:
```python
def brute_force_movie_festival(movies):
    """
    Find maximum movies using brute force approach
    
    Args:
        movies: list of (start, end) tuples
    
    Returns:
        int: maximum number of non-overlapping movies
    """
    def has_overlap(movie1, movie2):
        """Check if two movies overlap"""
        start1, end1 = movie1
        start2, end2 = movie2
        return not (end1 <= start2 or end2 <= start1)
    
    def is_valid_subset(subset):
        """Check if all movies in subset are non-overlapping"""
        for i in range(len(subset)):
            for j in range(i + 1, len(subset)):
                if has_overlap(subset[i], subset[j]):
                    return False
        return True
    
    from itertools import combinations
    
    max_movies = 0
    n = len(movies)
    
    # Try all possible subsets
    for k in range(n + 1):
        for subset in combinations(movies, k):
            if is_valid_subset(subset):
                max_movies = max(max_movies, len(subset))
    
    return max_movies

# Example usage
movies = [(3, 5), (4, 9), (5, 8)]
result = brute_force_movie_festival(movies)
print(f"Brute force result: {result}")  # Output: 2
```

**Time Complexity**: O(2^n √ó n¬≤) - All subsets with overlap checking
**Space Complexity**: O(n) - For storing subsets

**Why it's inefficient**: Exponential time complexity makes it impractical for large inputs.

### Approach 2: Optimized - Greedy by Start Time

**Key Insights from Optimized Approach**:
- **Greedy Strategy**: Select movies greedily based on start time
- **Early Selection**: Choose movies that start early to maximize opportunities
- **Overlap Avoidance**: Skip movies that overlap with already selected ones
- **Efficient Selection**: Process movies in sorted order

**Key Insight**: Sort movies by start time and greedily select the first non-overlapping movie.

**Algorithm**:
- Sort movies by start time
- Greedily select movies that don't overlap with previously selected ones
- Keep track of the last selected movie's end time

**Visual Example**:
```
Movies: [(3,5), (4,9), (5,8)]

Step 1: Sort by start time
Sorted: [(3,5), (4,9), (5,8)]

Step 2: Greedy selection
1. Select (3,5) ‚Üí last_end = 5
2. Skip (4,9) ‚Üí overlaps (4 < 5)
3. Select (5,8) ‚Üí no overlap (5 >= 5)

Selected: [(3,5), (5,8)] ‚Üí 2 movies
```

**Implementation**:
```python
def optimized_movie_festival(movies):
    """
    Find maximum movies using greedy by start time
    
    Args:
        movies: list of (start, end) tuples
    
    Returns:
        int: maximum number of non-overlapping movies
    """
    # Sort by start time
    sorted_movies = sorted(movies, key=lambda x: x[0])
    
    selected = []
    last_end = 0
    
    for start, end in sorted_movies:
        # If this movie doesn't overlap with the last selected
        if start >= last_end:
            selected.append((start, end))
            last_end = end
    
    return len(selected)

# Example usage
movies = [(3, 5), (4, 9), (5, 8)]
result = optimized_movie_festival(movies)
print(f"Optimized result: {result}")  # Output: 2
```

**Time Complexity**: O(n log n) - Sorting dominates
**Space Complexity**: O(1) - If not storing selected movies

**Why it's better**: Much more efficient than brute force, but not always optimal.

---

### Approach 3: Optimal - Greedy by End Time

**Key Insights from Optimal Approach**:
- **Optimal Greedy Choice**: Always select the movie that ends earliest
- **Mathematical Proof**: This greedy choice leads to optimal solution
- **Efficient Processing**: Sort once and process linearly
- **Maximum Movies**: Guarantees maximum number of non-overlapping movies

**Key Insight**: Sort movies by end time and always select the movie that ends earliest among available options.

**Algorithm**:
- Sort movies by end time
- Greedily select movies that end earliest and don't overlap
- This guarantees the optimal solution

**Visual Example**:
```
Movies: [(3,5), (4,9), (5,8)]

Step 1: Sort by end time
Sorted: [(3,5), (5,8), (4,9)]

Step 2: Greedy selection by end time
1. Select (3,5) ‚Üí ends earliest, last_end = 5
2. Select (5,8) ‚Üí ends earliest among remaining, no overlap
3. Skip (4,9) ‚Üí overlaps with (5,8)

Selected: [(3,5), (5,8)] ‚Üí 2 movies (optimal)
```

**Implementation**:
```python
def optimal_movie_festival(movies):
    """
    Find maximum movies using greedy by end time (optimal)
    
    Args:
        movies: list of (start, end) tuples
    
    Returns:
        int: maximum number of non-overlapping movies
    """
    # Sort by end time
    sorted_movies = sorted(movies, key=lambda x: x[1])
    
    count = 0
    last_end = 0
    
    for start, end in sorted_movies:
        # If this movie doesn't overlap with the last selected
        if start >= last_end:
            count += 1
            last_end = end
    
    return count

# Example usage
movies = [(3, 5), (4, 9), (5, 8)]
result = optimal_movie_festival(movies)
print(f"Optimal result: {result}")  # Output: 2
```

**Time Complexity**: O(n log n) - Sorting dominates
**Space Complexity**: O(1) - Constant extra space

**Why it's optimal**: The greedy choice of selecting the movie that ends earliest is mathematically proven to give the optimal solution.

## üîß Implementation Details

| Approach | Time Complexity | Space Complexity | Key Insight |
|----------|----------------|------------------|-------------|
| Brute Force | O(2^n √ó n¬≤) | O(n) | Try all subsets |
| Greedy by Start Time | O(n log n) | O(1) | Select earliest starting movies |
| Greedy by End Time | O(n log n) | O(1) | Select earliest ending movies |

### Time Complexity
- **Time**: O(n log n) - Sorting dominates the complexity
- **Space**: O(1) - Constant extra space for optimal approach

### Why This Solution Works
- **Greedy Choice Property**: Selecting the movie that ends earliest is always optimal
- **Optimal Substructure**: Optimal solution contains optimal solutions to subproblems
- **Mathematical Proof**: The greedy algorithm is proven to give the maximum number of movies
- **Optimal Approach**: Greedy by end time provides the best theoretical and practical performance

## üöÄ Problem Variations

### Extended Problems with Detailed Code Examples

### Variation 1: Movie Festival with Weights
**Problem**: Each movie has a weight (priority/score), and we want to maximize total weight instead of count.

**Link**: [CSES Problem Set - Movie Festival with Weights](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/movie_festival_weights)

```python
def movie_festival_weights(movies):
    """
    Find maximum total weight of non-overlapping movies
    """
    # Sort movies by end time
    movies.sort(key=lambda x: x['end_time'])
    
    # Dynamic programming approach
    n = len(movies)
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        # Option 1: Don't include current movie
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1]
        
        # Option 2: Include current movie
        # Find the last movie that doesn't overlap
        last_compatible = -1
        for j in range(i - 1, -1, -1):
            if movies[j]['end_time'] <= movies[i - 1]['start_time']:
                last_compatible = j
                break
        
        if last_compatible != -1:
            dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[last_compatible + 1] + movies[i - 1]['weight'])
        else:
            dp[i] = max(dp[i], movies[i - 1]['weight'])
    
    return dp[n]

    n = len(movies)
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        # Option 1: Don't include current movie
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1]
        
        # Option 2: Include current movie
        # Binary search for last compatible movie
        left, right = 0, i - 1
        last_compatible = -1
        
        while left <= right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            if movies[mid]['end_time'] <= movies[i - 1]['start_time']:
                last_compatible = mid
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                right = mid - 1
        
        if last_compatible != -1:
            dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[last_compatible + 1] + movies[i - 1]['weight'])
        else:
            dp[i] = max(dp[i], movies[i - 1]['weight'])
    
    return dp[n]
```

### Variation 2: Movie Festival with Multiple Theaters
**Problem**: There are multiple theaters, and we want to maximize total movies across all theaters.

**Link**: [CSES Problem Set - Movie Festival Multiple Theaters](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/movie_festival_multiple_theaters)

```python
def movie_festival_multiple_theaters(movies, num_theaters):
    """
    Find maximum movies across multiple theaters
    """
    # Sort movies by end time
    movies.sort(key=lambda x: x['end_time'])
    
    # Track end times for each theater
    theater_end_times = [0] * num_theaters
    total_movies = 0
    
    for movie in movies:
        # Find theater with earliest end time
        best_theater = 0
        for i in range(1, num_theaters):
            if theater_end_times[i] < theater_end_times[best_theater]:
                best_theater = i
        
        # Check if movie can be scheduled in this theater
        if theater_end_times[best_theater] <= movie['start_time']:
            theater_end_times[best_theater] = movie['end_time']
            total_movies += 1
    
    return total_movies

def movie_festival_multiple_theaters_optimized(movies, num_theaters):
    """
    Optimized version using priority queue
    """
    import heapq
    
    # Sort movies by end time
    movies.sort(key=lambda x: x['end_time'])
    
    # Use min-heap to track theater end times
    theater_heap = [0] * num_theaters
    heapq.heapify(theater_heap)
    
    total_movies = 0
    
    for movie in movies:
        # Get theater with earliest end time
        earliest_end = heapq.heappop(theater_heap)
        
        # Check if movie can be scheduled
        if earliest_end <= movie['start_time']:
            heapq.heappush(theater_heap, movie['end_time'])
            total_movies += 1
        else:
            # Put back the theater end time
            heapq.heappush(theater_heap, earliest_end)
    
    return total_movies
```

### Variation 3: Movie Festival with Dynamic Scheduling
**Problem**: Movies can be added or removed dynamically, and we need to maintain optimal scheduling.

**Link**: [CSES Problem Set - Movie Festival Dynamic Scheduling](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/movie_festival_dynamic)

```python
class MovieFestivalDynamic:
    def __init__(self):
        self.movies = []
        self.scheduled_movies = []
        self.max_movies = 0
    
    def add_movie(self, start_time, end_time):
        """Add a new movie to the festival"""
        movie = {'start_time': start_time, 'end_time': end_time}
        self.movies.append(movie)
        self._update_schedule()
    
    def remove_movie(self, start_time, end_time):
        """Remove a movie from the festival"""
        movie = {'start_time': start_time, 'end_time': end_time}
        if movie in self.movies:
            self.movies.remove(movie)
            self._update_schedule()
    
    def _update_schedule(self):
        """Update the optimal schedule"""
        # Sort movies by end time
        sorted_movies = sorted(self.movies, key=lambda x: x['end_time'])
        
        self.scheduled_movies = []
        last_end_time = 0
        
        for movie in sorted_movies:
            if movie['start_time'] >= last_end_time:
                self.scheduled_movies.append(movie)
                last_end_time = movie['end_time']
        
        self.max_movies = len(self.scheduled_movies)
    
    def get_max_movies(self):
        """Get current maximum number of movies"""
        return self.max_movies
    
    def get_scheduled_movies(self):
        """Get current scheduled movies"""
        return self.scheduled_movies
```
