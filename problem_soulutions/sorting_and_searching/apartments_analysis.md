- Understand the maximum matching problem with size constraints
- Apply two-pointer technique for efficient matching
- Implement greedy algorithms for optimization problems
- Optimize matching algorithms using sorting and two pointers

### 📚 **Prerequisites**
Before attempting this problem, ensure you understand:
- **Algorithm Knowledge**: Two-pointer technique, greedy algorithms, sorting, matching
- **Data Structures**: Arrays, sorted arrays, two pointers
- **Mathematical Concepts**: Optimization, matching theory, greedy choice property

- **Related Problems**: Distinct Numbers (sorting), Sum of Two Values (two pointers), Collecting Numbers (greedy)

## 📋 Problem Description

Given n applicants and m apartments, each with a desired size, find the maximum number of applicants that can be assigned to apartments. An applicant can be assigned to an apartment if the apartment size is within their acceptable range [desired_size - k, desired_size + k].

This is a classic maximum matching problem that can be solved efficiently using the two-pointer technique after sorting.

**Input**: 
- First line: three integers n, m, k (number of applicants, apartments, and tolerance)
- Second line: n integers (desired apartment sizes)
- Third line: m integers (available apartment sizes)

**Output**: 
- Print one integer: the maximum number of assignments

**Constraints**:
- 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2×10⁵
- 0 ≤ k ≤ 10⁹
- 1 ≤ desired_size, apartment_size ≤ 10⁹

**Example**:
```
Input:
4 3 5
60 45 80 60
30 60 75

Output:
2

Explanation**: 
Applicant 1 (desired: 60) can get apartment 2 (size: 60) or apartment 3 (size: 75)
Applicant 2 (desired: 45) can get apartment 1 (size: 30) or apartment 2 (size: 60)
Applicant 3 (desired: 80) can get apartment 3 (size: 75)
Applicant 4 (desired: 60) can get apartment 2 (size: 60) or apartment 3 (size: 75)

Optimal assignment: Applicant 1 → Apartment 2, Applicant 3 → Apartment 3
Total assignments: 2
```

## 🔍 Solution Analysis: From Brute Force to Optimal

### Approach 1: Brute Force - Try All Possible Assignments

**Key Insights from Brute Force Approach**:
- **Exhaustive Matching**: Try all possible ways to assign applicants to apartments
- **Constraint Checking**: For each assignment, check if size constraints are satisfied
- **Maximum Tracking**: Keep track of the maximum number of valid assignments
- **Complete Coverage**: Guaranteed to find the optimal solution

**Key Insight**: Generate all possible assignments and find the one with maximum valid matches.

**Algorithm**:
- Generate all possible combinations of applicant-apartment assignments
- For each combination, check if all assignments satisfy size constraints
- Return the maximum number of valid assignments

**Visual Example**:
```
Applicants: [60, 45, 80, 60], Apartments: [30, 60, 75], k = 5

Try all possible assignments:
1. Assign all to first apartment (30): 
   - 60: [25, 35] ✗ (30 not in range)
   - 45: [40, 50] ✗ (30 not in range)
   - 80: [75, 85] ✗ (30 not in range)
   - 60: [55, 65] ✗ (30 not in range)
   → 0 assignments

2. Assign first to apartment 1, rest to apartment 2:
   - 60 → 30: ✗
   - 45 → 60: ✓ (60 in [40, 50])
   - 80 → 60: ✗
   - 60 → 60: ✓
   → 2 assignments

... (continue for all combinations)

Maximum assignments: 2
```

**Implementation**:
```python
def brute_force_apartments(applicants, apartments, k):
    """
    Find maximum assignments using brute force approach
    
    Args:
        applicants: list of desired sizes
        apartments: list of available apartment sizes
        k: tolerance value
    
    Returns:
        int: maximum number of assignments
    """
    from itertools import permutations
    
    n, m = len(applicants), len(apartments)
    max_assignments = 0
    
    # Try all possible assignments
    for perm in permutations(apartments, min(n, m)):
        assignments = 0
        for i in range(len(perm)):
            desired = applicants[i]
            apartment_size = perm[i]
            if abs(desired - apartment_size) <= k:
                assignments += 1
        max_assignments = max(max_assignments, assignments)
    
    return max_assignments

# Example usage
applicants = [60, 45, 80, 60]
apartments = [30, 60, 75]
k = 5
result = brute_force_apartments(applicants, apartments, k)
print(f"Brute force result: {result}")  # Output: 2
```

**Time Complexity**: O(n! × m! × n) - All permutations with validation
**Space Complexity**: O(n + m) - For storing permutations

**Why it's inefficient**: Factorial time complexity makes it impractical for large inputs.

### Approach 2: Optimized - Greedy with Sorting

**Key Insights from Optimized Approach**:
- **Greedy Strategy**: Assign each applicant to the smallest suitable apartment
- **Sorting Benefit**: Sort both lists to enable efficient matching
- **Optimal Greedy Choice**: Always choose the smallest available apartment that satisfies constraints
- **Efficient Matching**: Use two pointers to find suitable apartments

**Key Insight**: Sort both applicants and apartments, then greedily assign each applicant to the smallest suitable apartment.

**Algorithm**:
- Sort applicants and apartments
- For each applicant, find the smallest apartment that satisfies size constraints
- Mark used apartments to avoid double assignment

**Visual Example**:
```
Applicants: [60, 45, 80, 60], Apartments: [30, 60, 75], k = 5

Step 1: Sort
Sorted applicants: [45, 60, 60, 80]
Sorted apartments: [30, 60, 75]

Step 2: Greedy assignment
1. Applicant 45: Find apartment in range [40, 50]
   - Apartment 30: Not in range ✗
   - Apartment 60: Not in range ✗
   - Apartment 75: Not in range ✗
   → No assignment

2. Applicant 60: Find apartment in range [55, 65]
   - Apartment 30: Not in range ✗
   - Apartment 60: In range ✓ → Assign
   → Used apartments: [60]

3. Applicant 60: Find apartment in range [55, 65]
   - Apartment 30: Not in range ✗
   - Apartment 60: Already used ✗
   - Apartment 75: Not in range ✗
   → No assignment

4. Applicant 80: Find apartment in range [75, 85]
   - Apartment 30: Not in range ✗
   - Apartment 60: Already used ✗
   - Apartment 75: In range ✓ → Assign
   → Used apartments: [60, 75]

Total assignments: 2
```

**Implementation**:
```python
def optimized_apartments(applicants, apartments, k):
    """
    Find maximum assignments using greedy approach
    
    Args:
        applicants: list of desired sizes
        apartments: list of available apartment sizes
        k: tolerance value
    
    Returns:
        int: maximum number of assignments
    """
    # Sort both lists
    applicants.sort()
    apartments.sort()
    
    assignments = 0
    apartment_index = 0
    
    for desired in applicants:
        # Find smallest suitable apartment
        while apartment_index < len(apartments):
            if abs(desired - apartments[apartment_index]) <= k:
                assignments += 1
                apartment_index += 1
                break
            elif apartments[apartment_index] < desired - k:
                apartment_index += 1
            else:
                break
    
    return assignments

# Example usage
applicants = [60, 45, 80, 60]
apartments = [30, 60, 75]
k = 5
result = optimized_apartments(applicants, apartments, k)
print(f"Optimized result: {result}")  # Output: 2
```

**Time Complexity**: O(n log n + m log m) - Sorting dominates
**Space Complexity**: O(1) - If sorting in-place

**Why it's better**: Much more efficient than brute force, but can be further optimized.

### Approach 3: Optimal - Two Pointer Technique

**Key Insights from Optimal Approach**:
- **Two Pointers**: Use two pointers to efficiently match applicants with apartments
- **Sorted Processing**: Process applicants and apartments in sorted order
- **Optimal Matching**: Always match with the smallest suitable apartment
- **Linear Complexity**: Achieve linear time complexity after sorting

**Key Insight**: Use two pointers to efficiently find the optimal matching between sorted applicants and apartments.

**Algorithm**:
- Sort both applicants and apartments
- Use two pointers: one for applicants, one for apartments
- For each applicant, find the smallest suitable apartment
- Move pointers efficiently to avoid redundant checks

**Visual Example**:
```
Applicants: [60, 45, 80, 60], Apartments: [30, 60, 75], k = 5

Step 1: Sort
Sorted applicants: [45, 60, 60, 80]
Sorted apartments: [30, 60, 75]

Step 2: Two pointer matching
Applicant pointer: 0, Apartment pointer: 0

1. Applicant 45 (range [40, 50]):
   - Apartment 30: 30 < 40, move apartment pointer
   - Apartment 60: 60 > 50, no match
   → Move applicant pointer

2. Applicant 60 (range [55, 65]):
   - Apartment 60: 60 in [55, 65] ✓ → Match!
   → Move both pointers

3. Applicant 60 (range [55, 65]):
   - Apartment 75: 75 > 65, no match
   → Move applicant pointer

4. Applicant 80 (range [75, 85]):
   - Apartment 75: 75 in [75, 85] ✓ → Match!
   → Move both pointers

Total matches: 2
```

**Implementation**:
```python
def optimal_apartments(applicants, apartments, k):
    """
    Find maximum assignments using two pointer technique
    
    Args:
        applicants: list of desired sizes
        apartments: list of available apartment sizes
        k: tolerance value
    
    Returns:
        int: maximum number of assignments
    """
    # Sort both lists
    applicants.sort()
    apartments.sort()
    
    assignments = 0
    i = j = 0  # Two pointers
    
    while i < len(applicants) and j < len(apartments):
        desired = applicants[i]
        apartment_size = apartments[j]
        
        # Check if apartment is suitable
        if abs(desired - apartment_size) <= k:
            assignments += 1
            i += 1  # Move to next applicant
            j += 1  # Move to next apartment
        elif apartment_size < desired - k:
            j += 1  # Apartment too small, try next
        else:
            i += 1  # Apartment too large, try next applicant
    
    return assignments

# Example usage
applicants = [60, 45, 80, 60]
apartments = [30, 60, 75]
k = 5
result = optimal_apartments(applicants, apartments, k)
print(f"Optimal result: {result}")  # Output: 2
```

**Time Complexity**: O(n log n + m log m) - Sorting dominates, matching is O(n + m)
**Space Complexity**: O(1) - If sorting in-place

**Why it's optimal**: Efficient two-pointer technique with optimal time complexity.

## 🔧 Implementation Details

| Approach | Time Complexity | Space Complexity | Key Insight |
|----------|----------------|------------------|-------------|
| Brute Force | O(n! × m! × n) | O(n + m) | Try all assignments |
| Greedy with Sorting | O(n log n + m log m) | O(1) | Greedy matching |
| Two Pointers | O(n log n + m log m) | O(1) | Efficient matching |

### Time Complexity
- **Time**: O(n log n + m log m) - Sorting dominates, matching is linear
- **Space**: O(1) - If sorting in-place

### Why This Solution Works
- **Greedy Choice**: Always choose the smallest suitable apartment
- **Optimal Substructure**: Optimal solution contains optimal solutions to subproblems
- **Two Pointer Efficiency**: Avoid redundant comparisons
- **Optimal Approach**: Two-pointer technique provides best practical performance

## 🚀 Problem Variations

### Variation 3: Apartments with Time Windows
**Problem**: Apartments are available only during specific time windows, and applicants have availability periods.

## Problem Variations

### **Variation 1: Apartments with Multiple Criteria**
**Problem**: Assign apartments to applicants considering both size and price constraints.

**Approach**: Sort by multiple criteria and use advanced matching algorithms.

### **Variation 2: Apartments with Dynamic Updates**
**Problem**: Handle dynamic apartment availability and applicant arrivals.

**Approach**: Use balanced binary search trees for efficient updates and queries.

```

### **Variation 3: Apartments with Constraints**
