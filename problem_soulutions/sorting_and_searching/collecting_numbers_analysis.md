# Collecting Numbers - Greedy Collection Strategy

## üìã Problem Information

### üéØ **Learning Objectives**
By the end of this problem, you should be able to:
- Understand greedy algorithms and their applications
- Apply sorting techniques for optimization problems
- Implement efficient collection strategies using position tracking
- Optimize algorithms using coordinate compression and mapping
- Handle edge cases in collection problems (sorted arrays, reverse sorted arrays)

### üìö **Prerequisites**
Before attempting this problem, ensure you understand:
- **Algorithm Knowledge**: Greedy algorithms, sorting, coordinate compression, position tracking
- **Data Structures**: Arrays, hash maps, sorted arrays
- **Mathematical Concepts**: Optimization, greedy choice property, collection strategies
- **Programming Skills**: Sorting implementation, hash map operations, greedy algorithms
- **Related Problems**: Distinct Numbers (sorting), Apartments (greedy), Sum of Two Values (optimization)

## üìã Problem Description

Given an array of n integers, you need to collect them in increasing order. Each time you collect a number, you must collect the smallest available number that hasn't been collected yet. Find the minimum number of passes needed to collect all numbers.

This is a greedy optimization problem that can be solved efficiently by understanding the relationship between consecutive numbers in the sorted array.

**Input**: 
- First line: integer n (number of elements)
- Second line: n integers (the array elements)

**Output**: 
- Print one integer: the minimum number of passes needed

**Constraints**:
- 1 ‚â§ n ‚â§ 2√ó10‚Åµ
- 1 ‚â§ a_i ‚â§ 10‚Åπ

**Example**:
```
Input:
5
4 2 1 5 3

Output:
3

Explanation**: 
The array [4, 2, 1, 5, 3] needs 3 rounds:

Round 1: Collect {1}
- Start from left, find 1 at position 2
- Cannot collect 2 next (position 1 < position 2)

Round 2: Collect {2, 3}
- Start from left, find 2 at position 1
- Next find 3 at position 4 (4 > 1, valid)
- Cannot collect 4 next (position 0 < position 4)

Round 3: Collect {4, 5}
- Start from left, find 4 at position 0
- Next find 5 at position 3 (3 > 0, valid)

Total rounds: 3
```

## üîç Solution Analysis: From Brute Force to Optimal

### Approach 1: Brute Force - Simulate Collection Process

**Key Insights from Brute Force Approach**:
- **Simulation**: Simulate the actual collection process
- **Pass Tracking**: Keep track of which numbers have been collected in each pass
- **Greedy Selection**: In each pass, collect numbers in increasing order
- **Complete Simulation**: Guaranteed to find the correct number of passes

**Key Insight**: Simulate the collection process by repeatedly making passes until all numbers are collected.

**Algorithm**:
- While there are uncollected numbers:
  - Start a new pass
  - Collect numbers in increasing order of their values
  - Mark collected numbers as used
- Count the number of passes needed

**Visual Example**:
```
Array: [4, 2, 1, 5, 3]

Round 1:
- Start from left, find 1 at position 2
- Cannot collect 2 next (position 1 < position 2)
- Collected: [1]

Round 2:
- Start from left, find 2 at position 1
- Next find 3 at position 4 (4 > 1, valid)
- Cannot collect 4 next (position 0 < position 4)
- Collected: [2, 3]

Round 3:
- Start from left, find 4 at position 0
- Next find 5 at position 3 (3 > 0, valid)
- Collected: [4, 5]

Total rounds: 3
```

**Implementation**:
```python
def brute_force_collecting_numbers(arr):
    """
    Find minimum passes using brute force simulation
    
    Args:
        arr: list of integers
    
    Returns:
        int: minimum number of passes needed
    """
    n = len(arr)
    collected = [False] * n
    passes = 0
    
    while not all(collected):
        passes += 1
        last_position = -1
        
        # Collect numbers in increasing order
        for value in sorted(set(arr)):
            # Find uncollected occurrence of this value
            for i in range(n):
                if not collected[i] and arr[i] == value and i > last_position:
                    collected[i] = True
                    last_position = i
                    break
    
    return passes

# Example usage
arr = [4, 2, 1, 5, 3]
result = brute_force_collecting_numbers(arr)
print(f"Brute force result: {result}")  # Output: 3
```

**Time Complexity**: O(n¬≤ log n) - Multiple passes with sorting
**Space Complexity**: O(n) - For tracking collected status

**Why it's inefficient**: Multiple passes with repeated sorting make it slow for large inputs.

### Approach 2: Optimized - Position Tracking with Sorting

**Key Insights from Optimized Approach**:
- **Position Mapping**: Map each value to its position in the original array
- **Sorted Processing**: Process values in sorted order
- **Position Validation**: Check if current position is after the last collected position
- **Single Pass**: Process all values in a single pass through sorted array

**Key Insight**: Sort the values and track positions to determine how many passes are needed.

**Algorithm**:
- Create list of (value, position) pairs
- Sort by value
- Count passes by tracking position requirements

**Visual Example**:
```
Array: [4, 2, 1, 5, 3]

Step 1: Create (value, position) pairs
Pairs: [(4, 0), (2, 1), (1, 2), (5, 3), (3, 4)]

Step 2: Sort by value
Sorted: [(1, 2), (2, 1), (3, 4), (4, 0), (5, 3)]

Step 3: Count rounds
Round 1: position 2 (for value 1)
Round 2: positions 1, 4 (for values 2, 3) - position 1 < 2, so new round
Round 3: positions 0, 3 (for values 4, 5) - position 0 < 4, so new round

Total rounds: 3
```

**Implementation**:
```python
def optimized_collecting_numbers(arr):
    """
    Find minimum passes using position tracking
    
    Args:
        arr: list of integers
    
    Returns:
        int: minimum number of passes needed
    """
    # Create (value, position) pairs
    pairs = [(arr[i], i) for i in range(len(arr))]
    
    # Sort by value
    pairs.sort()
    
    passes = 1
    last_position = pairs[0][1]
    
    for i in range(1, len(pairs)):
        value, position = pairs[i]
        
        # If position is before last position, need new pass
        if position < last_position:
            passes += 1
        
        last_position = position
    
    return passes

# Example usage
arr = [4, 2, 1, 5, 3]
result = optimized_collecting_numbers(arr)
print(f"Optimized result: {result}")  # Output: 3
```

**Time Complexity**: O(n log n) - Sorting dominates
**Space Complexity**: O(n) - For storing pairs

**Why it's better**: Single pass through sorted array with efficient position tracking.

### Approach 3: Optimal - Coordinate Compression with Position Analysis

**Key Insights from Optimal Approach**:
- **Coordinate Compression**: Map values to compressed coordinates for efficiency
- **Position Analysis**: Analyze position relationships to determine passes
- **Efficient Mapping**: Use hash maps for O(1) value-to-position mapping
- **Linear Processing**: Process positions in linear time after sorting

**Key Insight**: Use coordinate compression and analyze position sequences to determine the minimum number of passes needed.

**Algorithm**:
- Compress coordinates to handle large values efficiently
- Sort values and track their positions
- Count passes by analyzing position sequences

**Visual Example**:
```
Array: [4, 2, 1, 5, 3]

Step 1: Coordinate compression
Values: [4, 2, 1, 5, 3] ‚Üí Compressed: [3, 1, 0, 4, 2]

Step 2: Create position mapping
Compressed value ‚Üí positions: {0: [2], 1: [1], 2: [4], 3: [0], 4: [3]}

Step 3: Process in compressed order
Order: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
Positions: [2, 1, 4, 0, 3]

Round analysis:
- Start with position 2 (for value 1)
- Next: position 1 < 2 ‚Üí new round needed
- Round 1: [2] (for value 1)
- Round 2: [1, 4] (for values 2, 3)
- Round 3: [0, 3] (for values 4, 5)

Total rounds: 3
```

**Implementation**:
```python
def optimal_collecting_numbers(arr):
    """
    Find minimum passes using coordinate compression
    
    Args:
        arr: list of integers
    
    Returns:
        int: minimum number of passes needed
    """
    # Coordinate compression
    unique_values = sorted(set(arr))
    value_to_compressed = {val: i for i, val in enumerate(unique_values)}
    
    # Create compressed array
    compressed = [value_to_compressed[val] for val in arr]
    
    # Create position mapping for compressed values
    positions = {}
    for i, comp_val in enumerate(compressed):
        if comp_val not in positions:
            positions[comp_val] = []
        positions[comp_val].append(i)
    
    passes = 1
    last_position = positions[0][0]  # First position of smallest value
    
    # Process in compressed order
    for comp_val in range(1, len(unique_values)):
        # Find first position of this value that's after last_position
        found_position = None
        for pos in positions[comp_val]:
            if pos > last_position:
                found_position = pos
                break
        
        if found_position is None:
            # Need new pass
            passes += 1
            last_position = positions[comp_val][0]
        else:
            last_position = found_position
    
    return passes

# Example usage
arr = [4, 2, 1, 5, 3]
result = optimal_collecting_numbers(arr)
print(f"Optimal result: {result}")  # Output: 3
```

**Time Complexity**: O(n log n) - Sorting for coordinate compression
**Space Complexity**: O(n) - For coordinate mapping and position storage

**Why it's optimal**: Efficient coordinate compression with optimal time complexity.

## üöÄ Problem Variations

### Extended Problems with Detailed Code Examples

### Variation 1: Collecting Numbers with Duplicates
**Problem**: Collect numbers in order when duplicates are allowed in the array.

**Link**: [CSES Problem Set - Collecting Numbers with Duplicates](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/collecting_numbers_duplicates)

```python
def collecting_numbers_duplicates(arr):
    """
    Collect numbers in order when duplicates are allowed
    """
    # Create a list of (value, original_index) pairs
    indexed_arr = [(val, i) for i, val in enumerate(arr)]
    
    # Sort by value, then by original index
    indexed_arr.sort()
    
    passes = 1
    last_position = indexed_arr[0][1]
    
    for i in range(1, len(indexed_arr)):
        val, pos = indexed_arr[i]
        
        if pos < last_position:
            # Need new pass
            passes += 1
        
        last_position = pos
    
    return passes
```

### Variation 2: Collecting Numbers with Constraints
**Problem**: Collect numbers with constraints (e.g., can only collect k numbers per pass).

**Link**: [CSES Problem Set - Collecting Numbers with Constraints](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/collecting_numbers_constraints)

```python
def collecting_numbers_constraints(arr, k):
    """
    Collect numbers with constraint of k numbers per pass
    """
    # Create position mapping
    positions = {}
    for i, val in enumerate(arr):
        if val not in positions:
            positions[val] = []
        positions[val].append(i)
    
    # Sort unique values
    sorted_values = sorted(positions.keys())
    
    passes = 0
    collected = set()
    
    while len(collected) < len(sorted_values):
        passes += 1
        numbers_in_pass = 0
        last_position = -1
        
        for val in sorted_values:
            if val in collected:
                continue
            
            # Find first position after last_position
            found_position = None
            for pos in positions[val]:
                if pos > last_position:
                    found_position = pos
                    break
            
            if found_position is not None and numbers_in_pass < k:
                collected.add(val)
                last_position = found_position
                numbers_in_pass += 1
    
    return passes
```

### Variation 3: Collecting Numbers with Weights
**Problem**: Each number has a weight, and we want to minimize the total weight of passes.

**Link**: [CSES Problem Set - Collecting Numbers with Weights](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/collecting_numbers_weights)

```python
def collecting_numbers_weights(arr, weights):
    """
    Collect numbers to minimize total weight of passes
    """
    # Create position mapping with weights
    positions = {}
    for i, (val, weight) in enumerate(zip(arr, weights)):
        if val not in positions:
            positions[val] = []
        positions[val].append((i, weight))
    
    # Sort unique values
    sorted_values = sorted(positions.keys())
    
    # Use dynamic programming to find optimal collection strategy
    n = len(sorted_values)
    dp = [float('inf')] * (1 << n)
    dp[0] = 0
    
    for mask in range(1 << n):
        if dp[mask] == float('inf'):
            continue
        
        # Try to collect numbers in a single pass
        last_position = -1
        current_weight = 0
        new_mask = mask
        
        for i, val in enumerate(sorted_values):
            if mask & (1 << i):
                continue
            
            # Find best position for this value
            best_pos = None
            best_weight = float('inf')
            
            for pos, weight in positions[val]:
                if pos > last_position and weight < best_weight:
                    best_pos = pos
                    best_weight = weight
            
            if best_pos is not None:
                new_mask |= (1 << i)
                current_weight += best_weight
                last_position = best_pos
        
        # Update DP
        if new_mask != mask:
            dp[new_mask] = min(dp[new_mask], dp[mask] + current_weight)
    
    return dp[(1 << n) - 1]
```
