# Towers

## Problem Statement
Given n cubes with side lengths a1,a2,â€¦,an, you want to build towers by stacking cubes. You can only place a cube on top of another cube if its side length is smaller than the side length of the cube below it. Find the minimum number of towers needed.

### Input
The first input line has an integer n: the number of cubes.
The second line has n integers a1,a2,â€¦,an: the side lengths of the cubes.

### Output
Print one integer: the minimum number of towers needed.

### Constraints
- 1 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 2â‹…10^5
- 1 â‰¤ ai â‰¤ 10^9

### Example
```
Input:
5
3 8 2 1 5

Output:
2
```

## Solution Progression

### Approach 1: Greedy with Sorting - O(nÂ²)
**Description**: Sort cubes and try to place each cube on the smallest possible tower.

```python
def towers_naive(n, cubes):
    cubes.sort()
    towers = []
    
    for cube in cubes:
        placed = False
        for i in range(len(towers)):
            if cube < towers[i]:
                towers[i] = cube
                placed = True
                break
        
        if not placed:
            towers.append(cube)
    
    return len(towers)
```

**Why this is inefficient**: For each cube, we need to check all towers, leading to O(nÂ²) time complexity.

### Improvement 1: Binary Search - O(n log n)
**Description**: Use binary search to find the smallest tower that can hold the current cube.

```python
import bisect

def towers_optimized(n, cubes):
    cubes.sort()
    towers = []
    
    for cube in cubes:
        # Find the smallest tower that can hold this cube
        idx = bisect.bisect_right(towers, cube)
        
        if idx < len(towers):
            towers[idx] = cube
        else:
            towers.append(cube)
    
    return len(towers)
```

**Why this improvement works**: We use binary search to find the optimal tower for each cube in O(log n) time, reducing the overall complexity to O(n log n).

## Final Optimal Solution

```python
import bisect

n = int(input())
cubes = list(map(int, input().split()))

def find_minimum_towers(n, cubes):
    cubes.sort()
    towers = []
    
    for cube in cubes:
        # Find the smallest tower that can hold this cube
        idx = bisect.bisect_right(towers, cube)
        
        if idx < len(towers):
            towers[idx] = cube
        else:
            towers.append(cube)
    
    return len(towers)

result = find_minimum_towers(n, cubes)
print(result)
```

    else:
        towers.append(cube)
    
    return towers
```

        # Find optimal tower
        idx = bisect.bisect_right(towers, cube)
        
        if idx < len(towers):
            towers[idx] = cube
        else:
            towers.append(cube)
    
    return towers
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Variations & Related Questions

### ðŸ”„ **Variations of the Original Problem**

#### **Variation 1: Weighted Towers**
**Problem**: Each cube has a weight. Find the minimum number of towers such that the total weight of each tower doesn't exceed a given limit.
```python
def weighted_towers(n, cubes, weights, max_weight):
    # Sort by cube size
    cube_data = [(cubes[i], weights[i]) for i in range(n)]
    cube_data.sort()
    
    towers = []  # Each tower is (top_cube_size, total_weight)
    
    for cube_size, weight in cube_data:
        placed = False
        
        # Try to place on existing towers
        for i in range(len(towers)):
            top_size, tower_weight = towers[i]
            if cube_size < top_size and tower_weight + weight <= max_weight:
                towers[i] = (cube_size, tower_weight + weight)
                placed = True
                break
        
        # Create new tower if can't place on existing ones
        if not placed:
            towers.append((cube_size, weight))
    
    return len(towers)
```

#### **Variation 2: Height-Constrained Towers**
**Problem**: Each tower has a maximum height limit. Find the minimum number of towers needed.
```python
def height_constrained_towers(n, cubes, max_height):
    cubes.sort()
    towers = []  # Each tower is (top_cube_size, height)
    
    for cube in cubes:
        placed = False
        
        # Try to place on existing towers
        for i in range(len(towers)):
            top_size, height = towers[i]
            if cube < top_size and height + 1 <= max_height:
                towers[i] = (cube, height + 1)
                placed = True
                break
        
        # Create new tower if can't place on existing ones
        if not placed:
            towers.append((cube, 1))
    
    return len(towers)
```

#### **Variation 3: Multi-dimensional Towers**
**Problem**: Cubes have multiple dimensions (length, width, height). A cube can only be placed on another if all its dimensions are smaller.
```python
def multi_dimensional_towers(n, cubes):
    # cubes[i] = (length, width, height)
    cubes.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1], x[2]))
    towers = []
    
    for cube in cubes:
        placed = False
        
        # Try to place on existing towers
        for i in range(len(towers)):
            top_cube = towers[i]
            if (cube[0] < top_cube[0] and 
                cube[1] < top_cube[1] and 
                cube[2] < top_cube[2]):
                towers[i] = cube
                placed = True
                break
        
        # Create new tower if can't place on existing ones
        if not placed:
            towers.append(cube)
    
    return len(towers)
```

#### **Variation 4: Tower Stability**
**Problem**: Each cube has a stability factor. A tower is stable if the sum of stability factors of all cubes in it is above a threshold.
```python
def stable_towers(n, cubes, stabilities, min_stability):
    cube_data = [(cubes[i], stabilities[i]) for i in range(n)]
    cube_data.sort()
    
    towers = []  # Each tower is (top_cube_size, total_stability)
    
    for cube_size, stability in cube_data:
        placed = False
        
        # Try to place on existing towers
        for i in range(len(towers)):
            top_size, tower_stability = towers[i]
            if cube_size < top_size and tower_stability + stability >= min_stability:
                towers[i] = (cube_size, tower_stability + stability)
                placed = True
                break
        
        # Create new tower if can't place on existing ones
        if not placed:
            towers.append((cube_size, stability))
    
    return len(towers)
```

#### **Variation 5: Tower Cost Optimization**
**Problem**: Each tower has a cost based on the cubes in it. Find the minimum total cost for all towers.
```python
def cost_optimized_towers(n, cubes, costs):
    # costs[i] = cost of cube i
    cube_data = [(cubes[i], costs[i]) for i in range(n)]
    cube_data.sort()
    
    towers = []  # Each tower is (top_cube_size, total_cost)
    
    for cube_size, cost in cube_data:
        placed = False
        min_cost_increase = float('inf')
        best_tower = -1
        
        # Find tower with minimum cost increase
        for i in range(len(towers)):
            top_size, tower_cost = towers[i]
            if cube_size < top_size:
                cost_increase = cost  # Cost of adding this cube
                if cost_increase < min_cost_increase:
                    min_cost_increase = cost_increase
                    best_tower = i
        
        # Place on best tower or create new one
        if best_tower != -1:
            towers[best_tower] = (cube_size, towers[best_tower][1] + cost)
        else:
            towers.append((cube_size, cost))
    
    return sum(tower[1] for tower in towers)
```
