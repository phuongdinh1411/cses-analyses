# CSES Towers - Problem Analysis

## Problem Statement
Given n cubes with side lengths a1,a2,…,an, you want to build towers by stacking cubes. You can only place a cube on top of another cube if its side length is smaller than the side length of the cube below it. Find the minimum number of towers needed.

### Input
The first input line has an integer n: the number of cubes.
The second line has n integers a1,a2,…,an: the side lengths of the cubes.

### Output
Print one integer: the minimum number of towers needed.

### Constraints
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5
- 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9

### Example
```
Input:
5
3 8 2 1 5

Output:
2
```

## Solution Progression

### Approach 1: Greedy with Sorting - O(n²)
**Description**: Sort cubes and try to place each cube on the smallest possible tower.

```python
def towers_naive(n, cubes):
    cubes.sort()
    towers = []
    
    for cube in cubes:
        placed = False
        for i in range(len(towers)):
            if cube < towers[i]:
                towers[i] = cube
                placed = True
                break
        
        if not placed:
            towers.append(cube)
    
    return len(towers)
```

**Why this is inefficient**: For each cube, we need to check all towers, leading to O(n²) time complexity.

### Improvement 1: Binary Search - O(n log n)
**Description**: Use binary search to find the smallest tower that can hold the current cube.

```python
import bisect

def towers_optimized(n, cubes):
    cubes.sort()
    towers = []
    
    for cube in cubes:
        # Find the smallest tower that can hold this cube
        idx = bisect.bisect_right(towers, cube)
        
        if idx < len(towers):
            towers[idx] = cube
        else:
            towers.append(cube)
    
    return len(towers)
```

**Why this improvement works**: We use binary search to find the optimal tower for each cube in O(log n) time, reducing the overall complexity to O(n log n).

## Final Optimal Solution

```python
import bisect

n = int(input())
cubes = list(map(int, input().split()))

def find_minimum_towers(n, cubes):
    cubes.sort()
    towers = []
    
    for cube in cubes:
        # Find the smallest tower that can hold this cube
        idx = bisect.bisect_right(towers, cube)
        
        if idx < len(towers):
            towers[idx] = cube
        else:
            towers.append(cube)
    
    return len(towers)

result = find_minimum_towers(n, cubes)
print(result)
```

## Notable Techniques

### 1. **Binary Search Placement**
```python

    towers = []
    
    for element in elements:
        idx = bisect.bisect_right(towers, element)
        
        if idx < len(towers):
            towers[idx] = element
        else:
            towers.append(element)
    
    return len(towers)
```

### 2. **Optimal Tower Selection**
```python
def select_optimal_tower(towers, cube):
    idx = bisect.bisect_right(towers, cube)
    
    if idx < len(towers):
        towers[idx] = cube
    else:
        towers.append(cube)
    
    return towers
```

### 3. **Tower Management**
```python
def manage_towers(cubes):
    cubes.sort()
    towers = []
    
    for cube in cubes:
        # Find optimal tower
        idx = bisect.bisect_right(towers, cube)
        
        if idx < len(towers):
            towers[idx] = cube
        else:
            towers.append(cube)
    
    return towers
```

## Problem-Solving Framework

1. **Identify problem type**: This is a tower building problem with optimal placement
2. **Choose approach**: Use greedy approach with binary search
3. **Sort elements**: Sort cubes in ascending order
4. **Initialize towers**: Start with empty tower list
5. **Place cubes**: Use binary search to find optimal tower for each cube
6. **Update towers**: Either replace existing tower or create new one
7. **Return result**: Output the minimum number of towers needed
