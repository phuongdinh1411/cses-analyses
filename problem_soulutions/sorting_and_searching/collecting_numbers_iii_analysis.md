## Problem Description

**Problem**: Given an array of n integers, you want to collect them in increasing order. You can collect a number if you have already collected all numbers smaller than it. Find the minimum number of rounds needed to collect all numbers, and also find the order in which numbers are collected.

**Input**: 
- First line: n (size of the array)
- Second line: n integers x‚ÇÅ, x‚ÇÇ, ..., x‚Çô (the array)

**Output**: Minimum number of rounds and the collection order.

**Example**:
```
Input:
5
4 2 1 5 3

Output:
2
1 2 3 4 5

Explanation: 
Round 1: Collect 1, 2, 3 (all smaller numbers are available)
Round 2: Collect 4, 5 (all smaller numbers have been collected)
Collection order: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
```

## üéØ Visual Example

### Input Array
```
Array: [4, 2, 1, 5, 3]
Index:  0  1  2  3  4
```

### Position Mapping
```
Number: 1  2  3  4  5
Position: 2  1  4  0  3
```

### Collection Process
```
Round 1: Collect numbers in order 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

Step 1: Collect 1
Position of 1: 2
Array: [4, 2, 1, 5, 3]
        ^  ^  ‚úì  ^  ^
        Can collect 1 (no smaller numbers needed)

Step 2: Collect 2
Position of 2: 1
Array: [4, 2, 1, 5, 3]
        ^  ‚úì  ‚úì  ^  ^
        Can collect 2 (1 is already collected)

Step 3: Collect 3
Position of 3: 4
Array: [4, 2, 1, 5, 3]
        ^  ‚úì  ‚úì  ^  ‚úì
        Can collect 3 (1 and 2 are already collected)

Step 4: Try to collect 4
Position of 4: 0
Array: [4, 2, 1, 5, 3]
        ‚úì  ‚úì  ‚úì  ^  ‚úì
        Can collect 4 (1, 2, 3 are already collected)

Step 5: Try to collect 5
Position of 5: 3
Array: [4, 2, 1, 5, 3]
        ‚úì  ‚úì  ‚úì  ‚úì  ‚úì
        Can collect 5 (1, 2, 3, 4 are already collected)

Round 1 Result: All numbers collected in 1 round!
Collection order: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

### Alternative Example (Requiring 2 Rounds)
```
Array: [4, 2, 1, 5, 3]
Index:  0  1  2  3  4

Position Mapping:
Number: 1  2  3  4  5
Position: 2  1  4  0  3

Collection Analysis:
- To collect 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 in order
- Check if positions are in increasing order

Position sequence: 2, 1, 4, 0, 3
- 1 ‚Üí 2: position 2 ‚Üí position 1 (backward jump!)
- 2 ‚Üí 3: position 1 ‚Üí position 4 (forward jump)
- 3 ‚Üí 4: position 4 ‚Üí position 0 (backward jump!)
- 4 ‚Üí 5: position 0 ‚Üí position 3 (forward jump)

Backward jumps: 2 ‚Üí 1, 4 ‚Üí 0
Number of backward jumps: 2
Minimum rounds needed: 2
```

### Round-by-Round Collection
```
Round 1: Collect 1, 2, 3
Array: [4, 2, 1, 5, 3]
        ^  ‚úì  ‚úì  ^  ‚úì
        Collected: 1, 2, 3

Round 2: Collect 4, 5
Array: [4, 2, 1, 5, 3]
        ‚úì  ‚úì  ‚úì  ‚úì  ‚úì
        Collected: 4, 5

Total rounds: 2
Collection order: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

### Key Insight
The algorithm counts backward jumps in the position sequence:
- Each backward jump requires a new round
- Forward jumps can be handled in the same round
- Minimum rounds = 1 + number of backward jumps
- Collection order is always the sorted array

## üéØ Solution Progression

### Step 1: Understanding the Problem
**What are we trying to do?**
- Collect numbers in increasing order
- Can only collect a number if all smaller numbers are already collected
- Find minimum rounds needed
- Determine collection order

**Key Observations:**
- Numbers must be collected in sorted order
- Need to track positions of each number
- Additional round needed when larger number comes before smaller number
- Collection order is simply the sorted array

### Step 2: Brute Force Approach
**Idea**: Simulate the collection process and track the order.

```python
def collecting_numbers_iii_brute_force(n, arr):
    # Create a list of (value, index) pairs
    pairs = [(arr[i], i) for i in range(n)]
    pairs.sort()  # Sort by value
    
    rounds = 0
    collected = set()
    collection_order = []
    
    while len(collected) < n:
        rounds += 1
        current_round = []
        
        for value, index in pairs:
            if index not in collected:
                # Check if we can collect this number
                can_collect = True
                for smaller_value, smaller_index in pairs:
                    if smaller_value < value and smaller_index not in collected:
                        can_collect = False
                        break
                
                if can_collect:
                    current_round.append(value)
                    collected.add(index)
        
        collection_order.extend(current_round)
        
        if not current_round:
            break
    
    return rounds, collection_order
```

**Why this works:**
- Simulates the actual collection process
- Checks all conditions for each number
- Simple to understand and implement
- O(n¬≤) time complexity

### Step 3: Position Tracking Optimization
**Idea**: Track positions and determine collection order efficiently.

```python
def collecting_numbers_iii_optimized(n, arr):
    # Create position array: pos[i] = position of number i in the array
    pos = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        pos[arr[i]] = i
    
    rounds = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        # If current number comes before the previous number in the array,
        # we need an additional round
        if pos[i] < pos[i - 1]:
            rounds += 1
    
    # The collection order is simply the sorted array
    collection_order = sorted(arr)
    
    return rounds, collection_order
```

**Why this is better:**
- O(n log n) time complexity
- Uses position tracking optimization
- Much more efficient
- Handles large constraints

### Step 4: Complete Solution
**Putting it all together:**

```python
def solve_collecting_numbers_iii():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Create position array: pos[i] = position of number i in the array
    pos = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        pos[arr[i]] = i
    
    rounds = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        # If current number comes before the previous number in the array,
        # we need an additional round
        if pos[i] < pos[i - 1]:
            rounds += 1
    
    # The collection order is simply the sorted array
    collection_order = sorted(arr)
    
    print(rounds)
    print(*collection_order)

# Main execution
if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve_collecting_numbers_iii()
```

**Why this works:**
- Optimal position tracking approach
- Handles all edge cases
- Efficient implementation
- Clear and readable code

### Step 5: Testing Our Solution
**Let's verify with examples:**

```python
def test_solution():
    test_cases = [
        (5, [4, 2, 1, 5, 3], (2, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])),
        (3, [1, 2, 3], (1, [1, 2, 3])),
        (3, [3, 2, 1], (3, [1, 2, 3])),
        (4, [2, 1, 4, 3], (2, [1, 2, 3, 4])),
    ]
    
    for n, arr, expected in test_cases:
        rounds, order = solve_test(n, arr)
        expected_rounds, expected_order = expected
        print(f"n={n}, arr={arr}")
        print(f"Expected: rounds={expected_rounds}, order={expected_order}")
        print(f"Got: rounds={rounds}, order={order}")
        print(f"{'‚úì PASS' if (rounds, order) == expected else '‚úó FAIL'}")
        print()

def solve_test(n, arr):
    # Create position array
    pos = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        pos[arr[i]] = i
    
    rounds = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        if pos[i] < pos[i - 1]:
            rounds += 1
    
    collection_order = sorted(arr)
    
    return rounds, collection_order

test_solution()
```

## üéØ Problem Variations

### Variation 1: Collecting Numbers with Weights
**Problem**: Each number has a weight. Find minimum rounds and maximum total weight collected.

```python
def collecting_numbers_with_weights(n, arr, weights):
    # Create position array
    pos = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        pos[arr[i]] = i
    
    rounds = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        if pos[i] < pos[i - 1]:
            rounds += 1
    
    # Calculate total weight (sum of all weights)
    total_weight = sum(weights)
    
    return rounds, total_weight
```

### Variation 2: Collecting Numbers with Constraints
**Problem**: Can only collect at most k numbers per round.

```python
def collecting_numbers_with_constraints(n, arr, k):
    # Create position array
    pos = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        pos[arr[i]] = i
    
    # Calculate minimum rounds needed
    rounds = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        if pos[i] < pos[i - 1]:
            rounds += 1
    
    # Add rounds needed due to constraint
    additional_rounds = (n + k - 1) // k - 1  # Ceiling division
    total_rounds = max(rounds, additional_rounds + 1)
    
    return total_rounds
```

### Variation 3: Collecting Numbers with Dependencies
**Problem**: Some numbers have dependencies on other numbers (not just smaller ones).

```python
def collecting_numbers_with_dependencies(n, arr, dependencies):
    # dependencies[i] = list of numbers that must be collected before i
    pos = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        pos[arr[i]] = i
    
    # Calculate rounds considering dependencies
    rounds = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        if pos[i] < pos[i - 1]:
            rounds += 1
    
    # Add rounds for dependencies
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for dep in dependencies.get(i, []):
            if pos[i] < pos[dep]:
                rounds += 1
    
    return rounds
```

### Variation 4: Dynamic Collecting Numbers
**Problem**: Support adding/removing numbers and recalculating rounds.

```python
class DynamicCollectingNumbers:
    def __init__(self):
        self.arr = []
        self.pos = {}
        self.rounds = 1
    
    def add_number(self, value):
        self.arr.append(value)
        self.pos[value] = len(self.arr) - 1
        self._recalculate_rounds()
    
    def remove_number(self, value):
        if value in self.pos:
            index = self.pos[value]
            self.arr.pop(index)
            del self.pos[value]
            
            # Update positions
            for i in range(index, len(self.arr)):
                self.pos[self.arr[i]] = i
            
            self._recalculate_rounds()
    
    def _recalculate_rounds(self):
        if not self.arr:
            self.rounds = 0
            return
        
        sorted_arr = sorted(self.arr)
        self.rounds = 1
        
        for i in range(1, len(sorted_arr)):
            if self.pos[sorted_arr[i]] < self.pos[sorted_arr[i-1]]:
                self.rounds += 1
    
    def get_rounds(self):
        return self.rounds
    
    def get_collection_order(self):
        return sorted(self.arr)
```

### Variation 5: Collecting Numbers with Time Constraints
**Problem**: Each number takes time to collect. Find minimum total time.

```python
def collecting_numbers_with_time(n, arr, times):
    # times[i] = time to collect number i
    pos = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        pos[arr[i]] = i
    
    rounds = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        if pos[i] < pos[i - 1]:
            rounds += 1
    
    # Calculate total time
    total_time = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        total_time += times[i]
    
    return rounds, total_time
```
