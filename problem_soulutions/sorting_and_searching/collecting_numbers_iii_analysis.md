# CSES Collecting Numbers III - Problem Analysis

## Problem Statement
Given an array of n integers, you want to collect them in increasing order. You can collect a number if you have already collected all numbers smaller than it. Find the minimum number of rounds needed to collect all numbers, and also find the order in which numbers are collected.

### Input
The first input line has an integer n: the size of the array.
The second line has n integers x1,x2,…,xn: the array.

### Output
Print the minimum number of rounds and the collection order.

### Constraints
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5
- 1 ≤ xi ≤ n

### Example
```
Input:
5
4 2 1 5 3

Output:
2
1 2 3 4 5
```

## Solution Progression

### Approach 1: Simulate Collection Process - O(n²)
**Description**: Simulate the collection process and track the order.

```python
def collecting_numbers_iii_naive(n, arr):
    # Create a list of (value, index) pairs
    pairs = [(arr[i], i) for i in range(n)]
    pairs.sort()  # Sort by value
    
    rounds = 0
    collected = set()
    collection_order = []
    
    while len(collected) < n:
        rounds += 1
        current_round = []
        
        for value, index in pairs:
            if index not in collected:
                # Check if we can collect this number
                can_collect = True
                for smaller_value, smaller_index in pairs:
                    if smaller_value < value and smaller_index not in collected:
                        can_collect = False
                        break
                
                if can_collect:
                    current_round.append(value)
                    collected.add(index)
        
        collection_order.extend(current_round)
        
        if not current_round:
            break
    
    return rounds, collection_order
```

**Why this is inefficient**: For each round, we need to check all remaining numbers, leading to O(n²) time complexity.

### Improvement 1: Position Tracking with Order - O(n log n)
**Description**: Track positions and determine collection order efficiently.

```python
def collecting_numbers_iii_optimized(n, arr):
    # Create position array: pos[i] = position of number i in the array
    pos = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        pos[arr[i]] = i
    
    rounds = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        # If current number comes before the previous number in the array,
        # we need an additional round
        if pos[i] < pos[i - 1]:
            rounds += 1
    
    # The collection order is simply the sorted array
    collection_order = sorted(arr)
    
    return rounds, collection_order
```

**Why this improvement works**: We can determine rounds using position analysis and the collection order is simply the sorted array.

## Final Optimal Solution

```python
n = int(input())
arr = list(map(int, input().split()))

def find_minimum_rounds_and_order(n, arr):
    # Create position array: pos[i] = position of number i in the array
    pos = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        pos[arr[i]] = i
    
    rounds = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        # If current number comes before the previous number in the array,
        # we need an additional round
        if pos[i] < pos[i - 1]:
            rounds += 1
    
    # The collection order is simply the sorted array
    collection_order = sorted(arr)
    
    return rounds, collection_order

rounds, order = find_minimum_rounds_and_order(n, arr)
print(rounds)
print(*order)
```

### 2. **Round Counting**
```python

    rounds = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        if pos[i] < pos[i - 1]:
            rounds += 1
    return rounds

```

## Problem-Solving Framework

1. **Identify problem type**: This is a collection order problem with order output
2. **Choose approach**: Use position tracking for efficient analysis
3. **Build position array**: Map values to their positions in the array
4. **Count rounds**: Count inversions in the position array
5. **Determine order**: Use sorted array as collection order
6. **Return result**: Output rounds and collection order
