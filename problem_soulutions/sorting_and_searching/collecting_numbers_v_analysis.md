## Problem Description

**Problem**: Given an array of n integers, you want to collect them in increasing order. You can collect a number if you have already collected all numbers smaller than it. Find the minimum number of rounds needed to collect all numbers, and also find the order in which numbers are collected in each round, along with their original positions.

**Input**: 
- First line: n (size of the array)
- Second line: n integers x‚ÇÅ, x‚ÇÇ, ..., x‚Çô (the array)

**Output**: Minimum number of rounds and the collection order for each round with positions.

**Example**:
```
Input:
5
4 2 1 5 3

Output:
2
Round 1: (1,3) (2,2)
Round 2: (3,5) (4,1) (5,4)

Explanation: 
Round 1: Collect 1 at position 3, 2 at position 2
Round 2: Collect 3 at position 5, 4 at position 1, 5 at position 4
```

## üéØ Visual Example

### Input Array
```
Array: [4, 2, 1, 5, 3]
Index:  0  1  2  3  4
Position: 1  2  3  4  5 (1-indexed)
```

### Position Mapping
```
Number: 1  2  3  4  5
Position: 3  2  5  1  4
```

### Collection Process
```
Round 1: Collect numbers in order 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

Step 1: Collect 1
Position of 1: 3
Array: [4, 2, 1, 5, 3]
        ^  ^  ‚úì  ^  ^
        Can collect 1 at position 3 (no smaller numbers needed)

Step 2: Collect 2
Position of 2: 2
Array: [4, 2, 1, 5, 3]
        ^  ‚úì  ‚úì  ^  ^
        Can collect 2 at position 2 (1 is already collected)

Step 3: Try to collect 3
Position of 3: 5
Array: [4, 2, 1, 5, 3]
        ^  ‚úì  ‚úì  ^  ‚úì
        Can collect 3 at position 5 (1 and 2 are already collected)

Step 4: Try to collect 4
Position of 4: 1
Array: [4, 2, 1, 5, 3]
        ‚úì  ‚úì  ‚úì  ^  ‚úì
        Can collect 4 at position 1 (1, 2, 3 are already collected)

Step 5: Try to collect 5
Position of 5: 4
Array: [4, 2, 1, 5, 3]
        ‚úì  ‚úì  ‚úì  ‚úì  ‚úì
        Can collect 5 at position 4 (1, 2, 3, 4 are already collected)

Round 1 Result: All numbers collected in 1 round!
Collection order: [(1,3), (2,2), (3,5), (4,1), (5,4)]
```

### Alternative Example (Requiring 2 Rounds)
```
Array: [4, 2, 1, 5, 3]
Index:  0  1  2  3  4
Position: 1  2  3  4  5 (1-indexed)

Position Mapping:
Number: 1  2  3  4  5
Position: 3  2  5  1  4

Collection Analysis:
- To collect 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 in order
- Check if positions are in increasing order

Position sequence: 3, 2, 5, 1, 4
- 1 ‚Üí 2: position 3 ‚Üí position 2 (backward jump!)
- 2 ‚Üí 3: position 2 ‚Üí position 5 (forward jump)
- 3 ‚Üí 4: position 5 ‚Üí position 1 (backward jump!)
- 4 ‚Üí 5: position 1 ‚Üí position 4 (forward jump)

Backward jumps: 3 ‚Üí 2, 5 ‚Üí 1
Number of backward jumps: 2
Minimum rounds needed: 2
```

### Round-by-Round Collection
```
Round 1: Collect 1, 2
Array: [4, 2, 1, 5, 3]
        ^  ‚úì  ‚úì  ^  ^
        Collected: (1,3), (2,2)

Round 2: Collect 3, 4, 5
Array: [4, 2, 1, 5, 3]
        ‚úì  ‚úì  ‚úì  ‚úì  ‚úì
        Collected: (3,5), (4,1), (5,4)

Total rounds: 2
Round 1: (1,3) (2,2)
Round 2: (3,5) (4,1) (5,4)
```

### Key Insight
The algorithm counts backward jumps in the position sequence:
- Each backward jump requires a new round
- Forward jumps can be handled in the same round
- Minimum rounds = 1 + number of backward jumps
- Numbers are grouped by their collection round with positions

## üéØ Solution Progression

### Step 1: Understanding the Problem
**What are we trying to do?**
- Collect numbers in increasing order
- Can only collect a number if all smaller numbers are already collected
- Find minimum rounds needed
- Determine collection order with positions for each round

**Key Observations:**
- Numbers must be collected in sorted order
- Need to track positions of each number
- Additional round needed when larger number comes before smaller number
- Need to output both value and position for each collected number

### Step 2: Brute Force Approach
**Idea**: Simulate the collection process and track the order with positions for each round.

```python
def collecting_numbers_v_brute_force(n, arr):
    # Create a list of (value, index) pairs
    pairs = [(arr[i], i + 1) for i in range(n)]
    pairs.sort()  # Sort by value
    
    rounds = 0
    collected = set()
    round_orders = []
    
    while len(collected) < n:
        rounds += 1
        current_round = []
        
        for value, index in pairs:
            if index not in collected:
                # Check if we can collect this number
                can_collect = True
                for smaller_value, smaller_index in pairs:
                    if smaller_value < value and smaller_index not in collected:
                        can_collect = False
                        break
                
                if can_collect:
                    current_round.append((value, index))
                    collected.add(index)
        
        round_orders.append(current_round)
        
        if not current_round:
            break
    
    return rounds, round_orders
```

**Why this works:**
- Simulates the actual collection process
- Checks all conditions for each number
- Tracks order with positions for each round
- Simple to understand and implement
- O(n¬≤) time complexity

### Step 3: Position Tracking Optimization
**Idea**: Track positions and determine collection order with positions for each round efficiently.

```python
def collecting_numbers_v_optimized(n, arr):
    # Create position array: pos[i] = position of number i in the array
    pos = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        pos[arr[i]] = i + 1  # 1-indexed positions
    
    # Determine which round each number belongs to
    round_numbers = [0] * (n + 1)
    current_round = 1
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if i > 1 and pos[i] < pos[i - 1]:
            current_round += 1
        round_numbers[i] = current_round
    
    # Group numbers by round with their positions
    rounds = {}
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        round_num = round_numbers[i]
        if round_num not in rounds:
            rounds[round_num] = []
        rounds[round_num].append((i, pos[i]))
    
    return current_round, rounds
```

**Why this is better:**
- O(n log n) time complexity
- Uses position tracking optimization
- Much more efficient
- Handles large constraints

### Step 4: Complete Solution
**Putting it all together:**

```python
def solve_collecting_numbers_v():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Create position array: pos[i] = position of number i in the array
    pos = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        pos[arr[i]] = i + 1  # 1-indexed positions
    
    # Determine which round each number belongs to
    round_numbers = [0] * (n + 1)
    current_round = 1
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if i > 1 and pos[i] < pos[i - 1]:
            current_round += 1
        round_numbers[i] = current_round
    
    # Group numbers by round with their positions
    rounds = {}
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        round_num = round_numbers[i]
        if round_num not in rounds:
            rounds[round_num] = []
        rounds[round_num].append((i, pos[i]))
    
    # Print results
    print(current_round)
    for round_num in range(1, current_round + 1):
        if round_num in rounds:
            round_items = [f"({value},{position})" for value, position in rounds[round_num]]
            print(f"Round {round_num}:", *round_items)

# Main execution
if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve_collecting_numbers_v()
```

**Why this works:**
- Optimal position tracking approach
- Handles all edge cases
- Efficient implementation
- Clear and readable code

### Step 5: Testing Our Solution
**Let's verify with examples:**

```python
def test_solution():
    test_cases = [
        (5, [4, 2, 1, 5, 3], (2, {1: [(1, 3), (2, 2)], 2: [(3, 5), (4, 1), (5, 4)]})),
        (3, [1, 2, 3], (1, {1: [(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3)]})),
        (3, [3, 2, 1], (3, {1: [(1, 3)], 2: [(2, 2)], 3: [(3, 1)]})),
        (4, [2, 1, 4, 3], (2, {1: [(1, 2), (2, 1)], 2: [(3, 4), (4, 3)]})),
    ]
    
    for n, arr, expected in test_cases:
        rounds, round_orders = solve_test(n, arr)
        expected_rounds, expected_orders = expected
        print(f"n={n}, arr={arr}")
        print(f"Expected: rounds={expected_rounds}, orders={expected_orders}")
        print(f"Got: rounds={rounds}, orders={round_orders}")
        print(f"{'‚úì PASS' if (rounds, round_orders) == expected else '‚úó FAIL'}")
        print()

def solve_test(n, arr):
    # Create position array
    pos = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        pos[arr[i]] = i + 1
    
    # Determine which round each number belongs to
    round_numbers = [0] * (n + 1)
    current_round = 1
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if i > 1 and pos[i] < pos[i - 1]:
            current_round += 1
        round_numbers[i] = current_round
    
    # Group numbers by round with their positions
    rounds = {}
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        round_num = round_numbers[i]
        if round_num not in rounds:
            rounds[round_num] = []
        rounds[round_num].append((i, pos[i]))
    
    return current_round, rounds

test_solution()
```

## üéØ Problem Variations

### Variation 1: Collecting Numbers with Weights and Positions
**Problem**: Each number has a weight. Find rounds and total weight per round with positions.

```python
def collecting_numbers_with_weights_positions(n, arr, weights):
    # Create position array
    pos = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        pos[arr[i]] = i + 1
    
    # Determine which round each number belongs to
    round_numbers = [0] * (n + 1)
    current_round = 1
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if i > 1 and pos[i] < pos[i - 1]:
            current_round += 1
        round_numbers[i] = current_round
    
    # Group numbers by round with their positions and weights
    rounds = {}
    round_weights = {}
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        round_num = round_numbers[i]
        if round_num not in rounds:
            rounds[round_num] = []
            round_weights[round_num] = 0
        rounds[round_num].append((i, pos[i], weights[i]))
        round_weights[round_num] += weights[i]
    
    return current_round, rounds, round_weights
```

### Variation 2: Collecting Numbers with Round Limits and Positions
**Problem**: Each round can collect at most k numbers. Include positions.

```python
def collecting_numbers_with_round_limits_positions(n, arr, k):
    # Create position array
    pos = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        pos[arr[i]] = i + 1
    
    # Determine which round each number belongs to
    round_numbers = [0] * (n + 1)
    current_round = 1
    numbers_in_current_round = 0
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if i > 1 and pos[i] < pos[i - 1]:
            current_round += 1
            numbers_in_current_round = 0
        
        if numbers_in_current_round >= k:
            current_round += 1
            numbers_in_current_round = 0
        
        round_numbers[i] = current_round
        numbers_in_current_round += 1
    
    # Group numbers by round with their positions
    rounds = {}
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        round_num = round_numbers[i]
        if round_num not in rounds:
            rounds[round_num] = []
        rounds[round_num].append((i, pos[i]))
    
    return current_round, rounds
```

### Variation 3: Collecting Numbers with Dependencies and Positions
**Problem**: Some numbers have dependencies on other numbers. Include positions.

```python
def collecting_numbers_with_dependencies_positions(n, arr, dependencies):
    # dependencies[i] = list of numbers that must be collected before i
    pos = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        pos[arr[i]] = i + 1
    
    # Determine which round each number belongs to
    round_numbers = [0] * (n + 1)
    current_round = 1
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if i > 1 and pos[i] < pos[i - 1]:
            current_round += 1
        
        # Check dependencies
        for dep in dependencies.get(i, []):
            if pos[i] < pos[dep]:
                current_round += 1
        
        round_numbers[i] = current_round
    
    # Group numbers by round with their positions
    rounds = {}
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        round_num = round_numbers[i]
        if round_num not in rounds:
            rounds[round_num] = []
        rounds[round_num].append((i, pos[i]))
    
    return current_round, rounds
```

### Variation 4: Dynamic Collecting Numbers with Positions
**Problem**: Support adding/removing numbers and recalculating rounds with positions.

```python
class DynamicCollectingNumbersPositions:
    def __init__(self):
        self.arr = []
        self.pos = {}
        self.round_numbers = {}
        self.rounds = {}
    
    def add_number(self, value):
        self.arr.append(value)
        self.pos[value] = len(self.arr)
        self._recalculate_rounds()
    
    def remove_number(self, value):
        if value in self.pos:
            index = self.pos[value] - 1
            self.arr.pop(index)
            del self.pos[value]
            
            # Update positions
            for i in range(index, len(self.arr)):
                self.pos[self.arr[i]] = i + 1
            
            self._recalculate_rounds()
    
    def _recalculate_rounds(self):
        if not self.arr:
            self.round_numbers = {}
            self.rounds = {}
            return
        
        sorted_arr = sorted(self.arr)
        current_round = 1
        self.round_numbers = {}
        self.rounds = {}
        
        for i in range(len(sorted_arr)):
            if i > 0 and self.pos[sorted_arr[i]] < self.pos[sorted_arr[i-1]]:
                current_round += 1
            
            self.round_numbers[sorted_arr[i]] = current_round
            
            if current_round not in self.rounds:
                self.rounds[current_round] = []
            self.rounds[current_round].append((sorted_arr[i], self.pos[sorted_arr[i]]))
    
    def get_rounds(self):
        return len(self.rounds) if self.rounds else 0
    
    def get_round_orders(self):
        return self.rounds
```

### Variation 5: Collecting Numbers with Time Constraints and Positions
**Problem**: Each number takes time to collect. Find rounds and time per round with positions.

```python
def collecting_numbers_with_time_positions(n, arr, times):
    # times[i] = time to collect number i
    pos = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        pos[arr[i]] = i + 1
    
    # Determine which round each number belongs to
    round_numbers = [0] * (n + 1)
    current_round = 1
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if i > 1 and pos[i] < pos[i - 1]:
            current_round += 1
        round_numbers[i] = current_round
    
    # Group numbers by round with their positions and times
    rounds = {}
    round_times = {}
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        round_num = round_numbers[i]
        if round_num not in rounds:
            rounds[round_num] = []
            round_times[round_num] = 0
        rounds[round_num].append((i, pos[i], times[i]))
        round_times[round_num] += times[i]
    
    return current_round, rounds, round_times
```
