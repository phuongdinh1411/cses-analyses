# Collecting Numbers V

## Problem Statement
Given an array of n integers, you want to collect them in increasing order. You can collect a number if you have already collected all numbers smaller than it. Find the minimum number of rounds needed to collect all numbers, and also find the order in which numbers are collected in each round, along with their original positions.

### Input
The first input line has an integer n: the size of the array.
The second line has n integers x1,x2,â€¦,xn: the array.

### Output
Print the minimum number of rounds and the collection order for each round with positions.

### Constraints
- 1 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 2â‹…10^5
- 1 â‰¤ xi â‰¤ n

### Example
```
Input:
5
4 2 1 5 3

Output:
2
Round 1: (1,3) (2,2)
Round 2: (3,5) (4,1) (5,4)
```

## Solution Progression

### Approach 1: Simulate Collection Process - O(nÂ²)
**Description**: Simulate the collection process and track the order with positions for each round.

```python
def collecting_numbers_v_naive(n, arr):
    # Create a list of (value, index) pairs
    pairs = [(arr[i], i + 1) for i in range(n)]
    pairs.sort()  # Sort by value
    
    rounds = 0
    collected = set()
    round_orders = []
    
    while len(collected) < n:
        rounds += 1
        current_round = []
        
        for value, index in pairs:
            if index not in collected:
                # Check if we can collect this number
                can_collect = True
                for smaller_value, smaller_index in pairs:
                    if smaller_value < value and smaller_index not in collected:
                        can_collect = False
                        break
                
                if can_collect:
                    current_round.append((value, index))
                    collected.add(index)
        
        round_orders.append(current_round)
        
        if not current_round:
            break
    
    return rounds, round_orders
```

**Why this is inefficient**: For each round, we need to check all remaining numbers, leading to O(nÂ²) time complexity.

### Improvement 1: Position Tracking with Round Analysis - O(n log n)
**Description**: Track positions and determine collection order with positions for each round efficiently.

```python
def collecting_numbers_v_optimized(n, arr):
    # Create position array: pos[i] = position of number i in the array
    pos = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        pos[arr[i]] = i + 1  # 1-indexed positions
    
    # Determine which round each number belongs to
    round_numbers = [0] * (n + 1)
    current_round = 1
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if i > 1 and pos[i] < pos[i - 1]:
            current_round += 1
        round_numbers[i] = current_round
    
    # Group numbers by round with their positions
    rounds = {}
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        round_num = round_numbers[i]
        if round_num not in rounds:
            rounds[round_num] = []
        rounds[round_num].append((i, pos[i]))
    
    return current_round, rounds
```

**Why this improvement works**: We can determine which round each number belongs to using position analysis and then group them with their positions accordingly.

## Final Optimal Solution

```python
n = int(input())
arr = list(map(int, input().split()))

def find_minimum_rounds_and_round_orders_with_positions(n, arr):
    # Create position array: pos[i] = position of number i in the array
    pos = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        pos[arr[i]] = i + 1  # 1-indexed positions
    
    # Determine which round each number belongs to
    round_numbers = [0] * (n + 1)
    current_round = 1
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if i > 1 and pos[i] < pos[i - 1]:
            current_round += 1
        round_numbers[i] = current_round
    
    # Group numbers by round with their positions
    rounds = {}
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        round_num = round_numbers[i]
        if round_num not in rounds:
            rounds[round_num] = []
        rounds[round_num].append((i, pos[i]))
    
    return current_round, rounds

total_rounds, round_orders = find_minimum_rounds_and_round_orders_with_positions(n, arr)
print(total_rounds)

for round_num in range(1, total_rounds + 1):
    if round_num in round_orders:"
        positions_str = " ".join([f"({value},{pos})" for value, pos in round_orders[round_num]])
        print(f"Round {round_num}: {positions_str}")
```

        rounds[round_num].append((i, pos[i]))

            current_round += 1
        round_numbers[i] = current_round
    
    # Group numbers by round with positions
    rounds = {}
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        round_num = round_numbers[i]
        if round_num not in rounds:

            if i > 1 and pos[i] < pos[i - 1]:
                current_round += 1
                increasing = False
            round_numbers[i] = current_round
    else:
        for i in range(n, 0, -1):

        rounds[round_num].append((i, pos[i]))
    
    return current_round, rounds
```

#### **Variation 5: Cost-Based Collection with Positions**
**Problem**: Each collection has a cost based on the position. Find the minimum total cost with positions.
```python
def cost_based_collecting_numbers_v(n, arr, costs):
    # costs[i] = cost of collecting number at position i
    pos = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        pos[arr[i]] = i + 1
    
    round_numbers = [0] * (n + 1)
    current_round = 1
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if i > 1 and pos[i] < pos[i - 1]:
            current_round += 1
        round_numbers[i] = current_round
    
    # Calculate total cost
    total_cost = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        total_cost += costs[pos[i] - 1]  # Convert back to 0-indexed
    
    # Group numbers by round with positions
    rounds = {}
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        round_num = round_numbers[i]
        if round_num not in rounds:
            rounds[round_num] = []
