## üìã Problem Description

You have n books to read. Each book i takes t[i] minutes to read. You have two people who can read books in parallel.

Find the minimum time needed to read all books if both people can work simultaneously.

**Input**: 
- First line: integer n (number of books)
- Second line: n integers t[1], t[2], ..., t[n] (time to read each book)

**Output**: 
- Print one integer: the minimum time needed to read all books

**Constraints**:
- 1 ‚â§ n ‚â§ 2√ó10‚Åµ
- 1 ‚â§ t[i] ‚â§ 10‚Å∂

**Example**:
```
Input:
3
4 2 5

Output:
6

Explanation**: 
Books: [4, 2, 5] minutes each

Optimal distribution:
- Person 1: Book 1 (4 minutes) + Book 2 (2 minutes) = 6 minutes
- Person 2: Book 3 (5 minutes) = 5 minutes

Total time: max(6, 5) = 6 minutes

Alternative distribution:
- Person 1: Book 1 (4 minutes) = 4 minutes
- Person 2: Book 2 (2 minutes) + Book 3 (5 minutes) = 7 minutes

Total time: max(4, 7) = 7 minutes

Minimum time: 6 minutes
```

## üîç Solution Analysis: From Brute Force to Optimal

### Approach 1: Brute Force - Try All Distributions

**Key Insights from Brute Force Approach**:
- **Exhaustive Search**: Try all possible ways to distribute books between two people
- **Complete Coverage**: Guaranteed to find the optimal solution
- **Simple Implementation**: Straightforward approach with bit manipulation
- **Inefficient**: Exponential time complexity

**Key Insight**: For each possible subset of books for person 1, calculate the time for both people and find the minimum.

**Algorithm**:
- For each possible subset of books (using bit manipulation):
  - Assign subset to person 1, remaining to person 2
  - Calculate total time for each person
  - Return minimum of maximum times

**Visual Example**:
```
Books: [4, 2, 5]

All possible distributions:
1. Person 1: [], Person 2: [4,2,5] ‚Üí max(0, 11) = 11
2. Person 1: [4], Person 2: [2,5] ‚Üí max(4, 7) = 7
3. Person 1: [2], Person 2: [4,5] ‚Üí max(2, 9) = 9
4. Person 1: [5], Person 2: [4,2] ‚Üí max(5, 6) = 6
5. Person 1: [4,2], Person 2: [5] ‚Üí max(6, 5) = 6
6. Person 1: [4,5], Person 2: [2] ‚Üí max(9, 2) = 9
7. Person 1: [2,5], Person 2: [4] ‚Üí max(7, 4) = 7
8. Person 1: [4,2,5], Person 2: [] ‚Üí max(11, 0) = 11

Minimum time: 6
```

**Implementation**:
```python
def brute_force_reading_books(books):
    """
    Find minimum time using brute force approach
    
    Args:
        books: list of book reading times
    
    Returns:
        int: minimum time needed
    """
    n = len(books)
    min_time = float('inf')
    
    # Try all possible subsets for person 1
    for mask in range(1 << n):
        person1_time = 0
        person2_time = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            if mask & (1 << i):
                person1_time += books[i]
            else:
                person2_time += books[i]
        
        min_time = min(min_time, max(person1_time, person2_time))
    
    return min_time

# Example usage
books = [4, 2, 5]
result = brute_force_reading_books(books)
print(f"Brute force result: {result}")  # Output: 6
```

**Time Complexity**: O(2^n √ó n) - Try all subsets
**Space Complexity**: O(1) - Constant extra space

**Why it's inefficient**: Exponential time complexity makes it impractical for large inputs.

### Approach 2: Optimized - Sort and Greedy Distribution

**Key Insights from Optimized Approach**:
- **Sorting**: Sort books by reading time for better processing
- **Greedy Distribution**: Assign books to the person with less current load
- **Better Complexity**: Achieve O(n log n) time complexity
- **Memory Trade-off**: Use more memory for better time complexity

**Key Insight**: Sort books by reading time and assign each book to the person with less current load.

**Algorithm**:
- Sort books by reading time in descending order
- For each book, assign to the person with less current load

**Visual Example**:
```
Books: [4, 2, 5]
Sorted: [5, 4, 2]

Processing:
- Book 5: Person 1 (0) vs Person 2 (0) ‚Üí Person 1: [5], Person 2: []
- Book 4: Person 1 (5) vs Person 2 (0) ‚Üí Person 1: [5], Person 2: [4]
- Book 2: Person 1 (5) vs Person 2 (4) ‚Üí Person 1: [5], Person 2: [4,2]

Final: Person 1: 5, Person 2: 6 ‚Üí max(5, 6) = 6
```

**Implementation**:
```python
def optimized_reading_books(books):
    """
    Find minimum time using optimized approach
    
    Args:
        books: list of book reading times
    
    Returns:
        int: minimum time needed
    """
    # Sort books by reading time in descending order
    sorted_books = sorted(books, reverse=True)
    
    person1_time = 0
    person2_time = 0
    
    for book_time in sorted_books:
        if person1_time <= person2_time:
            person1_time += book_time
        else:
            person2_time += book_time
    
    return max(person1_time, person2_time)

# Example usage
books = [4, 2, 5]
result = optimized_reading_books(books)
print(f"Optimized result: {result}")  # Output: 6
```

**Time Complexity**: O(n log n) - Sorting dominates
**Space Complexity**: O(1) - Constant extra space

**Why it's better**: Much more efficient than brute force with greedy optimization.

### Approach 3: Optimal - Mathematical Analysis

**Key Insights from Optimal Approach**:
- **Mathematical Insight**: The optimal solution has a mathematical formula
- **Load Balancing**: The optimal time is max(max_book, total_time/2)
- **Optimal Complexity**: Achieve O(n) time complexity
- **Efficient Implementation**: No need for complex algorithms

**Key Insight**: The optimal time is the maximum of the longest book and half the total reading time.

**Algorithm**:
- Calculate total reading time
- Find the longest book
- Return max(longest_book, total_time/2)

**Visual Example**:
```
Books: [4, 2, 5]

Total time: 4 + 2 + 5 = 11
Longest book: 5
Half total: 11 / 2 = 5.5

Optimal time: max(5, 5.5) = 5.5 ‚Üí 6 (rounded up)
```

**Implementation**:
```python
def optimal_reading_books(books):
    """
    Find minimum time using optimal mathematical approach
    
    Args:
        books: list of book reading times
    
    Returns:
        int: minimum time needed
    """
    total_time = sum(books)
    max_book = max(books)
    
    # Optimal time is max of longest book and half total time
    return max(max_book, (total_time + 1) // 2)

# Example usage
books = [4, 2, 5]
result = optimal_reading_books(books)
print(f"Optimal result: {result}")  # Output: 6
```

**Time Complexity**: O(n) - Single pass through books
**Space Complexity**: O(1) - Constant extra space

**Why it's optimal**: The mathematical approach provides the optimal solution with linear time complexity.
