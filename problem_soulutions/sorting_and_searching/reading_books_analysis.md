# Reading Books

## Problem Statement
Given n books, each with a reading time, find the minimum time needed to read all books. You can read books in parallel, but each book must be read completely before starting another.

### Input
The first input line has an integer n: the number of books.
The second line has n integers t1,t2,…,tn: the reading time of each book.

### Output
Print one integer: the minimum time needed to read all books.

### Constraints
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5
- 1 ≤ ti ≤ 10^9

### Example
```
Input:
3
2 8 3

Output:
8
```

## Solution Progression

### Approach 1: Brute Force - O(n!)
**Description**: Try all possible orderings of books.

```python
def reading_books_naive(n, times):
    from itertools import permutations
    min_time = float('inf')
    
    for order in permutations(range(n)):
        current_time = 0
        for book_idx in order:
            current_time += times[book_idx]
        min_time = min(min_time, current_time)
    
    return min_time
```

**Why this is inefficient**: We try all n! possible orderings, leading to factorial time complexity.

### Improvement 1: Greedy by Time - O(n log n)
**Description**: Sort books by reading time and read them in order.

```python
def reading_books_optimized(n, times):
    # Sort books by reading time (ascending)
    times.sort()
    
    # Total time is the sum of all reading times
    total_time = sum(times)
    
    return total_time
```

**Why this improvement works**: Since we can read books in parallel, the minimum time is simply the sum of all reading times. The order doesn't matter because we can start reading all books simultaneously.

## Final Optimal Solution

```python
n = int(input())
times = list(map(int, input().split()))

def find_minimum_reading_time(n, times):
    # Since we can read books in parallel, the minimum time is the sum of all times
    return sum(times)

result = find_minimum_reading_time(n, times)
print(result)
```

## Complexity Analysis

| Approach | Time Complexity | Space Complexity | Key Insight |
|----------|----------------|------------------|-------------|
| Brute Force | O(n!) | O(n) | Try all possible orderings |
| Greedy by Time | O(n) | O(1) | Sum all reading times |

## Key Insights for Other Problems

### 1. **Parallel Processing Problems**
**Principle**: When tasks can be done in parallel, the total time is the sum of individual times.
**Applicable to**: Parallel processing problems, scheduling problems, optimization problems

### 2. **Independent Tasks**
**Principle**: For independent tasks that can be done simultaneously, order doesn't matter.
**Applicable to**: Independent task problems, parallel problems, scheduling problems

### 3. **Sum-based Optimization**
**Principle**: When tasks can be parallelized, the optimal time is the sum of all task times.
**Applicable to**: Sum problems, optimization problems, parallel processing problems

## Notable Techniques

### 1. **Parallel Task Processing**
```python
def process_parallel_tasks(times):
    # For parallel tasks, total time is sum of all times
    return sum(times)
```

### 2. **Independent Task Optimization**
```python
def optimize_independent_tasks(tasks):
    # When tasks are independent and can be done in parallel
    return sum(tasks)
```

### 3. **Parallel Scheduling**
```python
def schedule_parallel_tasks(times):
    # Sort if needed for other constraints
    times.sort()
    
    # Total time for parallel execution
    return sum(times)
```

## Problem-Solving Framework

1. **Identify problem type**: This is a parallel processing problem with independent tasks
2. **Choose approach**: Use sum of all task times since tasks can be done in parallel
3. **Understand constraints**: Each book must be read completely, but can be read in parallel
4. **Calculate total time**: Sum all reading times
5. **Return result**: Output the minimum total reading time

## 🎯 Problem Variations & Related Questions

### 🔄 **Variations of the Original Problem**

#### **Variation 1: Reading Books with Dependencies**
**Problem**: Some books must be read before others. Find minimum time.
```python
def reading_books_with_dependencies(n, times, dependencies):
    # dependencies[i] = list of books that must be read before book i
    from collections import defaultdict, deque
    
    # Build dependency graph
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    in_degree = [0] * n
    
    for i, deps in enumerate(dependencies):
        for dep in deps:
            graph[dep].append(i)
            in_degree[i] += 1
    
    # Topological sort with time tracking
    queue = deque()
    completion_time = [0] * n
    
    # Add books with no dependencies
    for i in range(n):
        if in_degree[i] == 0:
            queue.append(i)
            completion_time[i] = times[i]
    
    while queue:
        book = queue.popleft()
        
        for next_book in graph[book]:
            in_degree[next_book] -= 1
            completion_time[next_book] = max(completion_time[next_book], 
                                           completion_time[book] + times[next_book])
            
            if in_degree[next_book] == 0:
                queue.append(next_book)
    
    return max(completion_time) if max(in_degree) == 0 else -1
```

#### **Variation 2: Reading Books with Limited Parallelism**
**Problem**: You can read at most k books simultaneously.
```python
def reading_books_limited_parallelism(n, times, k):
    # Use binary search to find minimum time
    def can_read_in_time(time_limit):
        # Sort books by reading time
        sorted_times = sorted(times, reverse=True)
        
        # Use priority queue to track when each reader becomes available
        import heapq
        readers = [0] * k  # Time when each reader becomes available
        
        for book_time in sorted_times:
            # Find reader that becomes available earliest
            earliest_reader = min(readers)
            if earliest_reader + book_time > time_limit:
                return False
            readers[readers.index(earliest_reader)] += book_time
        
        return True
    
    left = max(times)
    right = sum(times)
    
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if can_read_in_time(mid):
            right = mid
        else:
            left = mid + 1
    
    return left
```

#### **Variation 3: Reading Books with Priority**
**Problem**: Some books have higher priority and must be read first.
```python
def reading_books_with_priority(n, times, priorities):
    # Sort books by priority (higher first), then by time
    books = [(times[i], priorities[i], i) for i in range(n)]
    books.sort(key=lambda x: (-x[1], x[0]))  # Sort by priority desc, then time asc
    
    # Read books in priority order
    total_time = 0
    for time, priority, book_id in books:
        total_time += time
    
    return total_time
```

#### **Variation 4: Reading Books with Interruptions**
**Problem**: Books can be interrupted and resumed later.
```python
def reading_books_with_interruptions(n, times, max_interruptions):
    # Sort books by reading time
    times.sort()
    
    # Calculate total time considering interruptions
    total_time = sum(times)
    
    # If we can interrupt, we can potentially reduce time by parallelizing
    # But since we can read all books in parallel, interruptions don't help
    return total_time
```

#### **Variation 5: Reading Books with Dynamic Updates**
**Problem**: Support adding and removing books dynamically.
```python
class DynamicReadingBooks:
    def __init__(self):
        self.times = []
        self.total_time = 0
    
    def add_book(self, reading_time):
        self.times.append(reading_time)
        self.total_time += reading_time
        return self.total_time
    
    def remove_book(self, index):
        if 0 <= index < len(self.times):
            self.total_time -= self.times[index]
            self.times.pop(index)
        return self.total_time
    
    def get_minimum_time(self):
        return self.total_time
```
