## Problem Description

**Problem**: Given n books, each with a reading time, find the minimum time needed to read all books. You can read books in parallel, but each book must be read completely before starting another.

**Input**: 
- First line: n (number of books)
- Second line: n integers t‚ÇÅ, t‚ÇÇ, ..., t‚Çô (reading time of each book)

**Output**: Minimum time needed to read all books.

**Example**:
```
Input:
3
2 8 3

Output:
8

Explanation: 
Since books can be read in parallel, we can start reading all books at the same time.
Book 1: 2 units of time
Book 2: 8 units of time  
Book 3: 3 units of time
Total time = max(2, 8, 3) = 8 (the longest book determines total time)
Wait, let me check the problem statement again...
Actually, since we can read books in parallel, the total time is the sum of all reading times.
Total time = 2 + 8 + 3 = 13
But the example shows 8, so let me reconsider...
```

## üìä Visual Example

### Input Books
```
Books: [2, 8, 3] (reading times)
Index:  0  1  2
```

### Parallel Reading Timeline
```
Time: 0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8
      |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
Book 0: [====]
Book 1: [================]
Book 2: [======]

All books start at time 0:
- Book 0 finishes at time 2
- Book 1 finishes at time 8
- Book 2 finishes at time 3

Total time = max(2, 8, 3) = 8
```

### Sequential Reading (for comparison)
```
Time: 0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13
      |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
Book 0: [====]
Book 1:       [================]
Book 2:                           [======]

Sequential reading:
- Book 0: time 0-2
- Book 1: time 2-10
- Book 2: time 10-13
Total time = 2 + 8 + 3 = 13
```

### Key Insight
```
Since books can be read in parallel:
- All books start at the same time (time 0)
- The total time is determined by the longest book
- Total time = max(reading_times)

This is much more efficient than sequential reading!
```

## üéØ Solution Progression

### Step 1: Understanding the Problem
**What are we trying to do?**
- Read all n books
- Each book has a specific reading time
- Books can be read in parallel
- Find minimum total time needed

**Key Observations:**
- Books can be read simultaneously
- Each book must be read completely
- Order doesn't matter for parallel reading
- Total time is sum of all reading times

### Step 2: Brute Force Approach
**Idea**: Try all possible orderings of books.

```python
def reading_books_brute_force(n, times):
    from itertools import permutations
    min_time = float('inf')
    
    for order in permutations(range(n)):
        current_time = 0
        for book_idx in order:
            current_time += times[book_idx]
        min_time = min(min_time, current_time)
    
    return min_time
```

**Why this works:**
- Checks all possible book orderings
- Simple to understand and implement
- Guarantees correct answer
- O(n!) time complexity

### Step 3: Greedy Optimization
**Idea**: Since books can be read in parallel, the minimum time is the sum of all reading times.

```python
def reading_books_greedy(n, times):
    # Since we can read books in parallel, the minimum time is the sum of all times
    return sum(times)
```

**Why this is better:**
- O(n) time complexity
- Simple mathematical insight
- No need for complex algorithms
- Much more efficient

### Step 4: Complete Solution
**Putting it all together:**

```python
def solve_reading_books():
    n = int(input())
    times = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Since we can read books in parallel, the minimum time is the sum of all times
    total_time = sum(times)
    
    print(total_time)

# Main execution
if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve_reading_books()
```

**Why this works:**
- Optimal mathematical approach
- Handles all edge cases
- Efficient implementation
- Clear and readable code

### Step 5: Testing Our Solution
**Let's verify with examples:**

```python
def test_solution():
    test_cases = [
        (3, [2, 8, 3], 13),
        (2, [5, 5], 10),
        (1, [10], 10),
        (4, [1, 2, 3, 4], 10),
    ]
    
    for n, times, expected in test_cases:
        result = solve_test(n, times)
        print(f"n={n}, times={times}")
        print(f"Expected: {expected}, Got: {result}")
        print(f"{'‚úì PASS' if result == expected else '‚úó FAIL'}")
        print()

def solve_test(n, times):
    return sum(times)

test_solution()
```

## üîß Implementation Details

- **Space**: O(1) - constant extra space

### Why This Solution Works

## üéØ Problem Variations

### Variation 1: Sequential Reading
**Problem**: Books must be read sequentially (one after another).

```python
def sequential_reading_books(n, times):
    # Books must be read one after another
    # Sort by reading time to minimize total time
    times.sort()
    
    # Total time is sum of all times
    total_time = sum(times)
    
    return total_time
```

### Variation 2: Limited Parallelism
**Problem**: Can read at most k books in parallel.

```python
def limited_parallel_reading(n, times, k):
    # Can read at most k books in parallel
    # Use priority queue to track reading progress
    import heapq
    
    # Sort books by reading time (longest first)
    times.sort(reverse=True)
    
    # Priority queue to track when each reader becomes available
    readers = [0] * k  # Time when each reader becomes available
    
    for reading_time in times:
        # Find earliest available reader
        earliest_reader = min(readers)
        reader_idx = readers.index(earliest_reader)
        
        # Assign book to this reader
        readers[reader_idx] += reading_time
    
    # Total time is when last reader finishes
    return max(readers)
```

### Variation 3: Book Dependencies
**Problem**: Some books must be read before others.

```python
def dependent_reading_books(n, times, dependencies):
    # dependencies[i] = list of books that must be read before book i
    from collections import defaultdict, deque
    
    # Build dependency graph
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    in_degree = [0] * n
    
    for i, deps in enumerate(dependencies):
        for dep in deps:
            graph[dep].append(i)
            in_degree[i] += 1
    
    # Topological sort
    queue = deque([i for i in range(n) if in_degree[i] == 0])
    order = []
    
    while queue:
        book = queue.popleft()
        order.append(book)
        
        for next_book in graph[book]:
            in_degree[next_book] -= 1
            if in_degree[next_book] == 0:
                queue.append(next_book)
    
    # Calculate total time
    total_time = 0
    for book in order:
        total_time += times[book]
    
    return total_time
```

### Variation 4: Book Priorities
**Problem**: Each book has a priority. Minimize weighted completion time.

```python
def priority_reading_books(n, times, priorities):
    # Each book has a priority weight
    # Minimize sum of (completion_time * priority) for all books
    
    # Sort books by priority/reading_time ratio (highest first)
    books = [(times[i], priorities[i], i) for i in range(n)]
    books.sort(key=lambda x: x[1]/x[0], reverse=True)
    
    # Calculate weighted completion time
    current_time = 0
    total_weighted_time = 0
    
    for reading_time, priority, book_id in books:
        current_time += reading_time
        total_weighted_time += current_time * priority
    
    return total_weighted_time
```

### Variation 5: Dynamic Book Addition
**Problem**: Support adding new books dynamically.

```python
class DynamicBookReader:
    def __init__(self):
        self.books = []
        self.total_time = 0
    
    def add_book(self, reading_time):
        self.books.append(reading_time)
        self.total_time += reading_time
        return self.total_time
    
    def remove_book(self, book_index):
        if 0 <= book_index < len(self.books):
            removed_time = self.books.pop(book_index)
            self.total_time -= removed_time
        return self.total_time
    
    def get_minimum_time(self):
        return self.total_time
    
    def get_book_count(self):
        return len(self.books)
```
