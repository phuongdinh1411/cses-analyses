# CSES Reading Books - Problem Analysis

## Problem Statement
Given n books, each with a reading time, find the minimum time needed to read all books. You can read books in parallel, but each book must be read completely before starting another.

### Input
The first input line has an integer n: the number of books.
The second line has n integers t1,t2,…,tn: the reading time of each book.

### Output
Print one integer: the minimum time needed to read all books.

### Constraints
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5
- 1 ≤ ti ≤ 10^9

### Example
```
Input:
3
2 8 3

Output:
8
```

## Solution Progression

### Approach 1: Brute Force - O(n!)
**Description**: Try all possible orderings of books.

```python
def reading_books_naive(n, times):
    from itertools import permutations
    
    min_time = float('inf')
    
    for order in permutations(range(n)):
        current_time = 0
        for book_idx in order:
            current_time += times[book_idx]
        min_time = min(min_time, current_time)
    
    return min_time
```

**Why this is inefficient**: We try all n! possible orderings, leading to factorial time complexity.

### Improvement 1: Greedy by Time - O(n log n)
**Description**: Sort books by reading time and read them in order.

```python
def reading_books_optimized(n, times):
    # Sort books by reading time (ascending)
    times.sort()
    
    # Total time is the sum of all reading times
    total_time = sum(times)
    
    return total_time
```

**Why this improvement works**: Since we can read books in parallel, the minimum time is simply the sum of all reading times. The order doesn't matter because we can start reading all books simultaneously.

## Final Optimal Solution

```python
n = int(input())
times = list(map(int, input().split()))

def find_minimum_reading_time(n, times):
    # Since we can read books in parallel, the minimum time is the sum of all times
    return sum(times)

result = find_minimum_reading_time(n, times)
print(result)
```

## Complexity Analysis

| Approach | Time Complexity | Space Complexity | Key Insight |
|----------|----------------|------------------|-------------|
| Brute Force | O(n!) | O(n) | Try all possible orderings |
| Greedy by Time | O(n) | O(1) | Sum all reading times |

## Key Insights for Other Problems

### 1. **Parallel Processing Problems**
**Principle**: When tasks can be done in parallel, the total time is the sum of individual times.
**Applicable to**: Parallel processing problems, scheduling problems, optimization problems

### 2. **Independent Tasks**
**Principle**: For independent tasks that can be done simultaneously, order doesn't matter.
**Applicable to**: Independent task problems, parallel problems, scheduling problems

### 3. **Sum-based Optimization**
**Principle**: When tasks can be parallelized, the optimal time is the sum of all task times.
**Applicable to**: Sum problems, optimization problems, parallel processing problems

## Notable Techniques

### 1. **Parallel Task Processing**
```python
def process_parallel_tasks(times):
    # For parallel tasks, total time is sum of all times
    return sum(times)
```

### 2. **Independent Task Optimization**
```python
def optimize_independent_tasks(tasks):
    # When tasks are independent and can be done in parallel
    return sum(tasks)
```

### 3. **Parallel Scheduling**
```python
def schedule_parallel_tasks(times):
    # Sort if needed for other constraints
    times.sort()
    
    # Total time for parallel execution
    return sum(times)
```

## Problem-Solving Framework

1. **Identify problem type**: This is a parallel processing problem with independent tasks
2. **Choose approach**: Use sum of all task times since tasks can be done in parallel
3. **Understand constraints**: Each book must be read completely, but can be read in parallel
4. **Calculate total time**: Sum all reading times
5. **Return result**: Output the minimum total reading time
