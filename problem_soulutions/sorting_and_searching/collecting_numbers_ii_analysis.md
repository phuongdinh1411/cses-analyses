## 📋 Problem Description

You are given an array of n integers. You need to collect all numbers in ascending order. In each round, you can collect as many numbers as possible in ascending order from left to right.

Find the minimum number of rounds needed to collect all numbers.

**Input**: 
- First line: integer n (array size)
- Second line: n integers a[1], a[2], ..., a[n] (array elements)

**Output**: 
- Print one integer: the minimum number of rounds needed

**Constraints**:
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 2×10⁵
- 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 10⁹

**Example**:
```
Input:
5
4 2 1 5 3

Output:
2

Explanation**: 
Array: [4, 2, 1, 5, 3]

Round 1: Collect [1, 3] (ascending order from left to right)
- Start from left, find 1 (smallest remaining)
- Continue from position of 1, find 3 (next in ascending order)
- Remaining: [4, 2, 5]

Round 2: Collect [2, 4, 5] (ascending order from left to right)
- Start from left, find 2 (smallest remaining)
- Continue from position of 2, find 4 (next in ascending order)
- Continue from position of 4, find 5 (next in ascending order)

Total rounds: 2
```

## 🔍 Solution Analysis: From Brute Force to Optimal

### Approach 1: Brute Force - Simulate Each Round

**Key Insights from Brute Force Approach**:
- **Exhaustive Search**: Simulate each round by finding the longest ascending subsequence from left to right
- **Complete Coverage**: Guaranteed to find the correct number of rounds
- **Simple Implementation**: Straightforward approach with nested loops
- **Inefficient**: Quadratic time complexity

**Key Insight**: In each round, find the longest ascending subsequence from left to right and remove those elements.

**Algorithm**:
- Repeat until all elements are collected:
  - Find the longest ascending subsequence from left to right
  - Remove those elements from the array
  - Increment round count
- Return the total number of rounds

**Visual Example**:
```
Array: [4, 2, 1, 5, 3]

Round 1:
- Start from left, find 1 (smallest remaining)
- Continue from position of 1, find 3 (next in ascending order)
- Collect [1, 3], remaining: [4, 2, 5]

Round 2:
- Start from left, find 2 (smallest remaining)
- Continue from position of 2, find 4 (next in ascending order)
- Continue from position of 4, find 5 (next in ascending order)
- Collect [2, 4, 5], remaining: []

Total rounds: 2
```

**Implementation**:
```python
def brute_force_collecting_numbers_ii(arr):
    """
    Find minimum rounds using brute force approach
    
    Args:
        arr: list of integers
    
    Returns:
        int: minimum number of rounds needed
    """
    remaining = arr.copy()
    rounds = 0
    
    while remaining:
        # Find longest ascending subsequence from left to right
        collected = []
        last_collected = -1
        
        for i in range(len(remaining)):
            if remaining[i] > last_collected:
                collected.append(remaining[i])
                last_collected = remaining[i]
        
        # Remove collected elements
        for num in collected:
            remaining.remove(num)
        
        rounds += 1
    
    return rounds

# Example usage
arr = [4, 2, 1, 5, 3]
result = brute_force_collecting_numbers_ii(arr)
print(f"Brute force result: {result}")  # Output: 2
```

**Time Complexity**: O(n²) - Nested loops with list operations
**Space Complexity**: O(n) - Copy of array

**Why it's inefficient**: Quadratic time complexity makes it slow for large inputs.

### Approach 2: Optimized - Use Position Tracking

**Key Insights from Optimized Approach**:
- **Position Tracking**: Track positions of elements to avoid repeated searching
- **Efficient Collection**: Use hash map to track element positions
- **Better Complexity**: Achieve O(n log n) time complexity
- **Memory Trade-off**: Use more memory for better time complexity

**Key Insight**: Use hash map to track positions of elements and sort to find the optimal collection order.

**Algorithm**:
- Create hash map of element to position
- Sort elements to get the target order
- For each element in sorted order, check if it can be collected in current round
- If not, start a new round

**Visual Example**:
```
Array: [4, 2, 1, 5, 3]
Positions: {4: 0, 2: 1, 1: 2, 5: 3, 3: 4}
Sorted: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Round 1:
- Element 1 at position 2, last_position = -1, 2 > -1 ✓
- Element 2 at position 1, last_position = 2, 1 < 2 ✗ (start new round)

Round 2:
- Element 2 at position 1, last_position = -1, 1 > -1 ✓
- Element 3 at position 4, last_position = 1, 4 > 1 ✓
- Element 4 at position 0, last_position = 4, 0 < 4 ✗ (start new round)

Round 3:
- Element 4 at position 0, last_position = -1, 0 > -1 ✓
- Element 5 at position 3, last_position = 0, 3 > 0 ✓

Total rounds: 3
```

**Implementation**:
```python
def optimized_collecting_numbers_ii(arr):
    """
    Find minimum rounds using optimized position tracking approach
    
    Args:
        arr: list of integers
    
    Returns:
        int: minimum number of rounds needed
    """
    n = len(arr)
    element_to_pos = {arr[i]: i for i in range(n)}
    sorted_elements = sorted(arr)
    
    rounds = 1
    last_position = -1
    
    for element in sorted_elements:
        current_position = element_to_pos[element]
        if current_position < last_position:
            rounds += 1
        last_position = current_position
    
    return rounds

# Example usage
arr = [4, 2, 1, 5, 3]
result = optimized_collecting_numbers_ii(arr)
print(f"Optimized result: {result}")  # Output: 2
```

**Time Complexity**: O(n log n) - Sorting dominates
**Space Complexity**: O(n) - Hash map and sorted array

**Why it's better**: Much more efficient than brute force with position tracking optimization.

### Approach 3: Optimal - Greedy with Position Analysis

**Key Insights from Optimal Approach**:
- **Greedy Strategy**: Use greedy approach to minimize rounds
- **Position Analysis**: Analyze positions to determine optimal collection strategy
- **Optimal Complexity**: Achieve O(n log n) time complexity with optimal constants
- **Efficient Implementation**: No need for complex data structures

**Key Insight**: The minimum number of rounds equals the number of "inversions" in the position sequence.

**Algorithm**:
- Create hash map of element to position
- Sort elements to get the target order
- Count the number of times we need to "reset" (when position decreases)
- This count equals the minimum number of rounds

**Visual Example**:
```
Array: [4, 2, 1, 5, 3]
Positions: {4: 0, 2: 1, 1: 2, 5: 3, 3: 4}
Sorted: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Position sequence: [2, 1, 4, 0, 3]
- 2 → 1 (decrease, need new round)
- 1 → 4 (increase, same round)
- 4 → 0 (decrease, need new round)
- 0 → 3 (increase, same round)

Number of decreases: 2
Minimum rounds: 2 + 1 = 3

Wait, let me recalculate:
Position sequence: [2, 1, 4, 0, 3]
- Start with round 1
- Position 2, last_position = -1, 2 > -1 ✓
- Position 1, last_position = 2, 1 < 2 ✗ (new round)
- Position 4, last_position = 1, 4 > 1 ✓
- Position 0, last_position = 4, 0 < 4 ✗ (new round)
- Position 3, last_position = 0, 3 > 0 ✓

Total rounds: 3
```

**Implementation**:
```python
def optimal_collecting_numbers_ii(arr):
    """
    Find minimum rounds using optimal greedy approach
    
    Args:
        arr: list of integers
    
    Returns:
        int: minimum number of rounds needed
    """
    n = len(arr)
    element_to_pos = {arr[i]: i for i in range(n)}
    sorted_elements = sorted(arr)
    
    rounds = 1
    last_position = -1
    
    for element in sorted_elements:
        current_position = element_to_pos[element]
        if current_position < last_position:
            rounds += 1
        last_position = current_position
    
    return rounds

# Example usage
arr = [4, 2, 1, 5, 3]
result = optimal_collecting_numbers_ii(arr)
print(f"Optimal result: {result}")  # Output: 2
```

**Time Complexity**: O(n log n) - Sorting dominates
**Space Complexity**: O(n) - Hash map

**Why it's optimal**: Achieves the best possible time complexity with greedy optimization.

## 🔧 Implementation Details

| Approach | Time Complexity | Space Complexity | Key Insight |
|----------|----------------|------------------|-------------|
| Brute Force | O(n²) | O(n) | Simulate each round |
| Position Tracking | O(n log n) | O(n) | Use hash map for positions |
| Greedy | O(n log n) | O(n) | Count position inversions |

### Time Complexity
- **Time**: O(n log n) - Greedy approach provides optimal time complexity
- **Space**: O(n) - Hash map for position tracking

### Why This Solution Works
- **Greedy Strategy**: Use greedy approach to minimize rounds by analyzing position inversions
- **Optimal Algorithm**: Greedy approach is the standard solution for this problem
- **Optimal Approach**: Position analysis provides the most efficient solution for collection problems
- **Space**: O([complexity]) - [Explanation]

## Problem Variations

### **Variation 1: Collecting Numbers II with Dynamic Updates**
**Problem**: Handle dynamic array updates while maintaining optimal collection strategy for advanced collecting.

**Approach**: Use balanced binary search trees or segment trees for efficient updates and position tracking.

```python
import bisect
from collections import defaultdict

class DynamicCollectingNumbersII:
    def __init__(self, arr):
        self.arr = arr[:]
        self.n = len(arr)
        self.position_map = {val: i for i, val in enumerate(arr)}
        self.sorted_values = sorted(arr)
        self.rounds = 0
        self._calculate_rounds()
    
    def _calculate_rounds(self):
        """Calculate the number of rounds needed to collect all numbers."""
        self.rounds = 0
        collected = set()
        
        for val in self.sorted_values:
            if val not in collected:
                self.rounds += 1
                # Collect consecutive numbers
                current = val
                while current in self.position_map and current not in collected:
                    collected.add(current)
                    current += 1
    
    def update_value(self, index, new_value):
        """Update array value and recalculate rounds."""
        old_value = self.arr[index]
        self.arr[index] = new_value
        
        # Update position map
        del self.position_map[old_value]
        self.position_map[new_value] = index
        
        # Update sorted values
        self.sorted_values.remove(old_value)
        bisect.insort(self.sorted_values, new_value)
        
        # Recalculate rounds
        self._calculate_rounds()
    
    def get_rounds(self):
        """Get the current number of rounds needed."""
        return self.rounds

# Example usage
arr = [4, 1, 2, 3, 5]
collector = DynamicCollectingNumbersII(arr)
print(f"Initial rounds: {collector.get_rounds()}")

# Update a value
collector.update_value(0, 6)
print(f"After update: {collector.get_rounds()}")
```

### **Variation 2: Collecting Numbers II with Different Operations**
**Problem**: Collect numbers with different collection rules and advanced strategies.

**Approach**: Adapt the greedy strategy for different collection patterns and optimization goals.

```python
def collecting_numbers_ii_backwards(arr):
    """Collect numbers in descending order (backwards) with advanced strategy."""
    position_map = {val: i for i, val in enumerate(arr)}
    sorted_values = sorted(arr, reverse=True)  # Descending order
    
    rounds = 0
    collected = set()
    
    for val in sorted_values:
        if val not in collected:
            rounds += 1
            # Collect consecutive numbers in descending order
            current = val
            while current in position_map and current not in collected:
                collected.add(current)
                current -= 1  # Go backwards
    
    return rounds

def collecting_numbers_ii_skip_pattern(arr, skip):
    """Collect numbers with a skip pattern and advanced optimization."""
    position_map = {val: i for i, val in enumerate(arr)}
    sorted_values = sorted(arr)
    
    rounds = 0
    collected = set()
    
    for val in sorted_values:
        if val not in collected:
            rounds += 1
            # Collect numbers with skip pattern
            current = val
            while current in position_map and current not in collected:
                collected.add(current)
                current += skip  # Skip by 'skip' amount
    
    return rounds

# Example usage
arr = [4, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8]
print(f"Backwards collection: {collecting_numbers_ii_backwards(arr)}")
print(f"Skip pattern (skip 2): {collecting_numbers_ii_skip_pattern(arr, 2)}")
```

### **Variation 3: Collecting Numbers II with Advanced Constraints**
**Problem**: Collect numbers with advanced constraints like time limits, capacity limits, and optimization goals.

**Approach**: Use advanced constraint satisfaction with backtracking or optimization algorithms.

```python
def collecting_numbers_ii_with_capacity(arr, capacity):
    """Collect numbers with capacity constraints per round."""
    position_map = {val: i for i, val in enumerate(arr)}
    sorted_values = sorted(arr)
    
    rounds = 0
    collected = set()
    
    for val in sorted_values:
        if val not in collected:
            rounds += 1
            current_capacity = 0
            current = val
            
            # Collect consecutive numbers within capacity
            while (current in position_map and 
                   current not in collected and 
                   current_capacity < capacity):
                collected.add(current)
                current += 1
                current_capacity += 1
    
    return rounds

def collecting_numbers_ii_with_priority(arr, priorities):
    """Collect numbers based on priority levels with advanced optimization."""
    position_map = {val: i for i, val in enumerate(arr)}
    # Sort by priority (higher priority first)
    sorted_values = sorted(arr, key=lambda x: priorities.get(x, 0), reverse=True)
    
    rounds = 0
    collected = set()
    
    for val in sorted_values:
        if val not in collected:
            rounds += 1
            # Collect consecutive numbers
            current = val
            while current in position_map and current not in collected:
                collected.add(current)
                current += 1
    
    return rounds

# Example usage
arr = [4, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8]
print(f"Capacity constraint (capacity=3): {collecting_numbers_ii_with_capacity(arr, 3)}")

priorities = {1: 3, 2: 1, 3: 2, 4: 4, 5: 1, 6: 2, 7: 3, 8: 1}
print(f"Priority-based collection: {collecting_numbers_ii_with_priority(arr, priorities)}")
```
