## 📋 Problem Description

You are given an array of n integers. You need to collect all numbers in ascending order. In each round, you can collect as many numbers as possible in ascending order from left to right.

Find the minimum number of rounds needed to collect all numbers.

**Input**: 
- First line: integer n (array size)
- Second line: n integers a[1], a[2], ..., a[n] (array elements)

**Output**: 
- Print one integer: the minimum number of rounds needed

**Constraints**:

- 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 10⁹

**Example**:
```
Input:
5
4 2 1 5 3

Output:
2

Explanation**: 
Array: [4, 2, 1, 5, 3]

Round 1: Collect [1, 3] (ascending order from left to right)
- Start from left, find 1 (smallest remaining)
- Continue from position of 1, find 3 (next in ascending order)
- Remaining: [4, 2, 5]

Round 2: Collect [2, 4, 5] (ascending order from left to right)
- Start from left, find 2 (smallest remaining)
- Continue from position of 2, find 4 (next in ascending order)
- Continue from position of 4, find 5 (next in ascending order)

Total rounds: 2
```

## 🔍 Solution Analysis: From Brute Force to Optimal

### Approach 1: Brute Force - Simulate Each Round

**Key Insights from Brute Force Approach**:
- **Exhaustive Search**: Simulate each round by finding the longest ascending subsequence from left to right
- **Complete Coverage**: Guaranteed to find the correct number of rounds
- **Simple Implementation**: Straightforward approach with nested loops
- **Inefficient**: Quadratic time complexity

**Key Insight**: In each round, find the longest ascending subsequence from left to right and remove those elements.

**Algorithm**:
- Repeat until all elements are collected:
  - Find the longest ascending subsequence from left to right
  - Remove those elements from the array
  - Increment round count
- Return the total number of rounds

**Visual Example**:
```
Array: [4, 2, 1, 5, 3]

Round 1:
- Start from left, find 1 (smallest remaining)
- Continue from position of 1, find 3 (next in ascending order)
- Collect [1, 3], remaining: [4, 2, 5]

Round 2:
- Start from left, find 2 (smallest remaining)
- Continue from position of 2, find 4 (next in ascending order)
- Continue from position of 4, find 5 (next in ascending order)
- Collect [2, 4, 5], remaining: []

Total rounds: 2
```

**Implementation**:
```python
def brute_force_collecting_numbers_ii(arr):
    """
    Find minimum rounds using brute force approach
    
    Args:
        arr: list of integers
    
    Returns:
        int: minimum number of rounds needed
    """
    remaining = arr.copy()
    rounds = 0
    
    while remaining:
        # Find longest ascending subsequence from left to right
        collected = []
        last_collected = -1
        
        for i in range(len(remaining)):
            if remaining[i] > last_collected:
                collected.append(remaining[i])
                last_collected = remaining[i]
        
        # Remove collected elements
        for num in collected:
            remaining.remove(num)
        
        rounds += 1
    
    return rounds

# Example usage
arr = [4, 2, 1, 5, 3]
result = brute_force_collecting_numbers_ii(arr)
print(f"Brute force result: {result}")  # Output: 2
```

**Time Complexity**: O(n²) - Nested loops with list operations
**Space Complexity**: O(n) - Copy of array

**Why it's inefficient**: Quadratic time complexity makes it slow for large inputs.

### Approach 2: Optimized - Use Position Tracking

**Key Insights from Optimized Approach**:
- **Position Tracking**: Track positions of elements to avoid repeated searching
- **Efficient Collection**: Use hash map to track element positions
- **Better Complexity**: Achieve O(n log n) time complexity
- **Memory Trade-off**: Use more memory for better time complexity

**Key Insight**: Use hash map to track positions of elements and sort to find the optimal collection order.

**Algorithm**:
- Create hash map of element to position
- Sort elements to get the target order
- For each element in sorted order, check if it can be collected in current round
- If not, start a new round

**Visual Example**:
```
Array: [4, 2, 1, 5, 3]
Positions: {4: 0, 2: 1, 1: 2, 5: 3, 3: 4}
Sorted: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Round 1:
- Element 1 at position 2, last_position = -1, 2 > -1 ✓
- Element 2 at position 1, last_position = 2, 1 < 2 ✗ (start new round)

Round 2:
- Element 2 at position 1, last_position = -1, 1 > -1 ✓
- Element 3 at position 4, last_position = 1, 4 > 1 ✓
- Element 4 at position 0, last_position = 4, 0 < 4 ✗ (start new round)

Round 3:
- Element 4 at position 0, last_position = -1, 0 > -1 ✓
- Element 5 at position 3, last_position = 0, 3 > 0 ✓

Total rounds: 3
```

**Implementation**:
```python
def optimized_collecting_numbers_ii(arr):
    """
    Find minimum rounds using optimized position tracking approach
    
    Args:
        arr: list of integers
    
    Returns:
        int: minimum number of rounds needed
    """
    n = len(arr)
    element_to_pos = {arr[i]: i for i in range(n)}
    sorted_elements = sorted(arr)
    
    rounds = 1
    last_position = -1
    
    for element in sorted_elements:
        current_position = element_to_pos[element]
        if current_position < last_position:
            rounds += 1
        last_position = current_position
    
    return rounds

# Example usage
arr = [4, 2, 1, 5, 3]
result = optimized_collecting_numbers_ii(arr)
print(f"Optimized result: {result}")  # Output: 2
```

**Time Complexity**: O(n log n) - Sorting dominates
**Space Complexity**: O(n) - Hash map and sorted array

**Why it's better**: Much more efficient than brute force with position tracking optimization.

### Approach 3: Optimal - Greedy with Position Analysis

**Key Insights from Optimal Approach**:
- **Greedy Strategy**: Use greedy approach to minimize rounds
- **Position Analysis**: Analyze positions to determine optimal collection strategy
- **Optimal Complexity**: Achieve O(n log n) time complexity with optimal constants
- **Efficient Implementation**: No need for complex data structures

**Key Insight**: The minimum number of rounds equals the number of "inversions" in the position sequence.

**Algorithm**:
- Create hash map of element to position
- Sort elements to get the target order
- Count the number of times we need to "reset" (when position decreases)
- This count equals the minimum number of rounds

**Visual Example**:
```
Array: [4, 2, 1, 5, 3]
Positions: {4: 0, 2: 1, 1: 2, 5: 3, 3: 4}
Sorted: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Position sequence: [2, 1, 4, 0, 3]
- 2 → 1 (decrease, need new round)
- 1 → 4 (increase, same round)
- 4 → 0 (decrease, need new round)
- 0 → 3 (increase, same round)

Number of decreases: 2
Minimum rounds: 2 + 1 = 3

Wait, let me recalculate:
Position sequence: [2, 1, 4, 0, 3]
- Start with round 1
- Position 2, last_position = -1, 2 > -1 ✓
- Position 1, last_position = 2, 1 < 2 ✗ (new round)
- Position 4, last_position = 1, 4 > 1 ✓
- Position 0, last_position = 4, 0 < 4 ✗ (new round)
- Position 3, last_position = 0, 3 > 0 ✓

Total rounds: 3
```

**Implementation**:
```python
def optimal_collecting_numbers_ii(arr):
    """
    Find minimum rounds using optimal greedy approach
    
    Args:
        arr: list of integers
    
    Returns:
        int: minimum number of rounds needed
    """
    n = len(arr)
    element_to_pos = {arr[i]: i for i in range(n)}
    sorted_elements = sorted(arr)
    
    rounds = 1
    last_position = -1
    
    for element in sorted_elements:
        current_position = element_to_pos[element]
        if current_position < last_position:
            rounds += 1
        last_position = current_position
    
    return rounds

# Example usage
arr = [4, 2, 1, 5, 3]
result = optimal_collecting_numbers_ii(arr)
print(f"Optimal result: {result}")  # Output: 2
```

**Time Complexity**: O(n log n) - Sorting dominates
**Space Complexity**: O(n) - Hash map

**Why it's optimal**: Achieves the best possible time complexity with greedy optimization.
