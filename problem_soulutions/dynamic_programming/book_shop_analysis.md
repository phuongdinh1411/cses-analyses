# Book Shop

## Problem Description

**Problem**: You are in a book shop with n different books. Each book has a price and number of pages. You have a budget of x and want to maximize the total number of pages you can buy. You can buy each book at most once.

**Input**: 
- n, x: number of books and maximum total price
- h1, h2, ..., hn: price of each book
- s1, s2, ..., sn: number of pages of each book

**Output**: Maximum number of pages you can buy within the budget.

**Example**:
```
Input:
4 10
4 8 5 3
5 12 8 1

Output:
13

Explanation: 
We can buy books with prices [4, 5, 1] = 10 (within budget)
Total pages: 5 + 8 + 1 = 14

Or buy books with prices [4, 3, 3] = 10 (within budget)  
Total pages: 5 + 1 + 1 = 7

Actually, the optimal solution is:
Buy books with prices [4, 5, 1] = 10
Total pages: 5 + 8 + 1 = 14

Wait, let me recalculate:
Book 1: price 4, pages 5
Book 2: price 8, pages 12  
Book 3: price 5, pages 8
Book 4: price 3, pages 1

Optimal: Buy books 1 and 3
Total price: 4 + 5 = 9 â‰¤ 10
Total pages: 5 + 8 = 13
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Solution Progression

### Step 1: Understanding the Problem
**What are we trying to do?**
- Choose a subset of books to buy
- Maximize total pages within budget constraint
- Each book can be bought at most once
- This is a 0/1 knapsack problem

**Key Observations:**
- For each book, we have 2 choices: buy or don't buy
- We need to track remaining budget
- This is a classic dynamic programming problem
- Can use 2D DP table

### Step 2: Dynamic Programming Approach
**Idea**: Use 2D DP table to store maximum pages for each budget and book combination.

```python
def book_shop_dp(n, x, prices, pages):
    # dp[i][j] = max pages using first i books with budget j
    dp = [[0] * (x + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(x + 1):
            # Don't buy current book
            dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]
            
            # Buy current book if we have enough money
            if j >= prices[i-1]:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i-1][j - prices[i-1]] + pages[i-1])
    
    return dp[n][x]
```

**Why this works:**
- Uses optimal substructure property
- Handles all cases correctly
- Efficient implementation
- O(n*x) time complexity

### Step 3: Complete Solution
**Putting it all together:**

```python
def solve_book_shop():
    n, x = map(int, input().split())
    prices = list(map(int, input().split()))
    pages = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # dp[i][j] = max pages using first i books with budget j
    dp = [[0] * (x + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(x + 1):
            # Don't buy current book
            dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]
            
            # Buy current book if we have enough money
            if j >= prices[i-1]:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i-1][j - prices[i-1]] + pages[i-1])
    
    print(dp[n][x])

# Main execution
if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve_book_shop()
```

**Why this works:**
- Optimal dynamic programming approach
- Handles all edge cases
- Efficient implementation
- Clear and readable code

### Step 4: Testing Our Solution
**Let's verify with examples:**

```python
def test_solution():
    test_cases = [
        (4, 10, [4, 8, 5, 3], [5, 12, 8, 1], 13),
        (3, 5, [2, 3, 4], [3, 4, 5], 7),
        (2, 3, [1, 2], [2, 3], 5),
    ]
    
    for n, x, prices, pages, expected in test_cases:
        result = solve_test(n, x, prices, pages)
        print(f"n={n}, x={x}, prices={prices}, pages={pages}, expected={expected}, result={result}")
        assert result == expected, f"Failed for n={n}, x={x}"
        print("âœ“ Passed")
        print()

def solve_test(n, x, prices, pages):
    # dp[i][j] = max pages using first i books with budget j
    dp = [[0] * (x + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(x + 1):
            # Don't buy current book
            dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]
            
            # Buy current book if we have enough money
            if j >= prices[i-1]:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i-1][j - prices[i-1]] + pages[i-1])
    
    return dp[n][x]

test_solution()
```

## ðŸ”§ Implementation Details

### Time Complexity
- **Time**: O(n*x) - we fill a 2D DP table
- **Space**: O(n*x) - we store the entire DP table

### Why This Solution Works
- **Dynamic Programming**: Efficiently computes optimal book selection using optimal substructure
- **State Transition**: dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i-1][j-price[i-1]] + pages[i-1])
- **Base Case**: dp[0][j] = 0 for all j (no books selected)
- **Optimal Substructure**: Optimal solution can be built from smaller subproblems

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Variations

### Variation 1: Unbounded Knapsack
**Problem**: You can buy each book multiple times.

```python
def unbounded_book_shop(n, x, prices, pages):
    # dp[j] = max pages with budget j
    dp = [0] * (x + 1)
    
    for j in range(1, x + 1):
        for i in range(n):
            if j >= prices[i]:
                dp[j] = max(dp[j], dp[j - prices[i]] + pages[i])
    
    return dp[x]

# Example usage
result = unbounded_book_shop(4, 10, [4, 8, 5, 3], [5, 12, 8, 1])
print(f"Unbounded max pages: {result}")
```

### Variation 2: Fractional Knapsack
**Problem**: You can buy fractional parts of books.

```python
def fractional_book_shop(n, x, prices, pages):
    # Sort by pages per price ratio
    books = [(pages[i] / prices[i], prices[i], pages[i]) for i in range(n)]
    books.sort(reverse=True)
    
    total_pages = 0
    remaining_budget = x
    
    for ratio, price, pages in books:
        if remaining_budget >= price:
            total_pages += pages
            remaining_budget -= price
        else:
            # Buy fractional part
            fraction = remaining_budget / price
            total_pages += pages * fraction
            break
    
    return total_pages

# Example usage
result = fractional_book_shop(4, 10, [4, 8, 5, 3], [5, 12, 8, 1])
print(f"Fractional max pages: {result}")
```

### Variation 3: Multiple Constraints
**Problem**: Books have both price and weight constraints.

```python
def constrained_book_shop(n, x, w, prices, pages, weights):
    # dp[i][j][k] = max pages using first i books with budget j and weight k
    dp = [[[0] * (w + 1) for _ in range(x + 1)] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(x + 1):
            for k in range(w + 1):
                # Don't buy current book
                dp[i][j][k] = dp[i-1][j][k]
                
                # Buy current book if constraints are satisfied
                if j >= prices[i-1] and k >= weights[i-1]:
                    dp[i][j][k] = max(dp[i][j][k], 
                                    dp[i-1][j - prices[i-1]][k - weights[i-1]] + pages[i-1])
    
    return dp[n][x][w]

# Example usage
result = constrained_book_shop(4, 10, 5, [4, 8, 5, 3], [5, 12, 8, 1], [2, 3, 2, 1])
print(f"Constrained max pages: {result}")
```

### Variation 4: Book Shop with Discounts
**Problem**: Books have volume discounts.

```python
def discounted_book_shop(n, x, prices, pages, discounts):
    # dp[i][j] = max pages using first i books with budget j
    dp = [[0] * (x + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(x + 1):
            # Don't buy current book
            dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]
            
            # Buy current book with discount
            discounted_price = prices[i-1] * (1 - discounts[i-1])
            if j >= discounted_price:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i-1][j - discounted_price] + pages[i-1])
    
    return dp[n][x]

# Example usage
discounts = [0.1, 0.2, 0.15, 0.05]  # 10%, 20%, 15%, 5% discounts
result = discounted_book_shop(4, 10, [4, 8, 5, 3], [5, 12, 8, 1], discounts)
print(f"Discounted max pages: {result}")
```

### Variation 5: Book Shop with Dynamic Programming Optimization
**Problem**: Optimize the DP solution for better performance.

```python
def optimized_book_shop(n, x, prices, pages):
    # Use 1D DP array to save space
    dp = [0] * (x + 1)
    
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(x, prices[i] - 1, -1):  # Reverse order to avoid overcounting
            dp[j] = max(dp[j], dp[j - prices[i]] + pages[i])
    
    return dp[x]

# Example usage
result = optimized_book_shop(4, 10, [4, 8, 5, 3], [5, 12, 8, 1])
print(f"Optimized max pages: {result}")
```

## ðŸ“š Learning Points

1. **Dynamic Programming**: Essential for knapsack problems
2. **2D DP Tables**: Important for item selection problems
3. **0/1 Knapsack**: Important for understanding constraints
4. **Space Optimization**: Important for performance improvement

**This is a great introduction to dynamic programming for knapsack problems!** ðŸŽ¯
        buy = float('-inf')
        if remaining_money >= prices[index]:
            buy = pages[index] + max_pages(index + 1, remaining_money - prices[index])
        
        memo[(index, remaining_money)] = max(not_buy, buy)
        return memo[(index, remaining_money)]
    
    return max_pages(0, x)
```

**Why this improvement works**: By storing the results of subproblems in a memo dictionary, we avoid recalculating the same values multiple times. Each subproblem is solved only once, leading to O(n*x) complexity.

### Improvement 2: Bottom-Up Dynamic Programming - O(n*x)
**Description**: Use iterative DP to build the solution from smaller subproblems.

```python
def book_shop_dp(n, x, prices, pages):
    # dp[i][j] = maximum pages using first i books with budget j
    dp = [[0] * (x + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(x + 1):
            # Don't buy current book
            dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]
            
            # Buy current book if we have enough money
            if j >= prices[i-1]:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i-1][j - prices[i-1]] + pages[i-1])
    
    return dp[n][x]
```

**Why this improvement works**: We build the solution iteratively by solving smaller subproblems first. For each book and budget, we decide whether to buy the book or not.

### Alternative: Space-Optimized DP - O(n*x)
**Description**: Use a space-optimized DP approach with only one row.

```python
def book_shop_optimized(n, x, prices, pages):
    # dp[j] = maximum pages with budget j
    dp = [0] * (x + 1)
    
    for i in range(n):
        # Process from right to left to avoid using the same book twice
        for j in range(x, prices[i] - 1, -1):
            dp[j] = max(dp[j], dp[j - prices[i]] + pages[i])
    
    return dp[x]
```

**Why this works**: We can optimize space by using only one row and processing from right to left to avoid using the same book multiple times.

## Final Optimal Solution

```python
n, x = map(int, input().split())
prices = list(map(int, input().split()))
pages = list(map(int, input().split()))

# dp[j] = maximum pages with budget j
dp = [0] * (x + 1)

for i in range(n):
    # Process from right to left to avoid using the same book twice
    for j in range(x, prices[i] - 1, -1):
        dp[j] = max(dp[j], dp[j - prices[i]] + pages[i])

print(dp[x])
```
