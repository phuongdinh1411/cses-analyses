# Book Shop

## Problem Statement
You are in a book shop which sells n different books. You know the price and number of pages of each book.

You have decided that the total price of your books will be at most x. What is the maximum number of pages you can buy? You can buy each book at most once.

### Input
The first input line contains two integers n and x: the number of books and the maximum total price.
The second line contains n integers h1,h2,â€¦,hn: the price of each book.
The third line contains n integers s1,s2,â€¦,sn: the number of pages of each book.

### Output
Print one integer: the maximum number of pages.

### Constraints
- 1 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 1000
- 1 â‰¤ x â‰¤ 10^5
- 1 â‰¤ hi,si â‰¤ 1000

### Example
```
Input:
4 10
4 8 5 3
5 12 8 1

Output:
13
```

## Solution Progression

### Approach 1: Recursive Brute Force - O(2^n)
**Description**: Try all possible combinations of books recursively.

```python
def book_shop_brute_force(n, x, prices, pages):
    def max_pages(index, remaining_money):
        if index == n:
            return 0
        if remaining_money < 0:
            return float('-inf')
        
        # Don't buy current book
        not_buy = max_pages(index + 1, remaining_money)
        
        # Buy current book
        buy = float('-inf')
        if remaining_money >= prices[index]:
            buy = pages[index] + max_pages(index + 1, remaining_money - prices[index])
        
        return max(not_buy, buy)
    
    return max_pages(0, x)
```

**Why this is inefficient**: We're trying all possible combinations of books, which leads to exponential complexity. For each book, we have 2 choices (buy or don't buy), leading to O(2^n) complexity.

### Improvement 1: Recursive with Memoization - O(n*x)
**Description**: Use memoization to avoid recalculating the same subproblems.

```python
def book_shop_memoization(n, x, prices, pages):
    memo = {}
    
    def max_pages(index, remaining_money):
        if (index, remaining_money) in memo:
            return memo[(index, remaining_money)]
        
        if index == n:
            return 0
        if remaining_money < 0:
            return float('-inf')
        
        # Don't buy current book
        not_buy = max_pages(index + 1, remaining_money)
        
        # Buy current book
        buy = float('-inf')
        if remaining_money >= prices[index]:
            buy = pages[index] + max_pages(index + 1, remaining_money - prices[index])
        
        memo[(index, remaining_money)] = max(not_buy, buy)
        return memo[(index, remaining_money)]
    
    return max_pages(0, x)
```

**Why this improvement works**: By storing the results of subproblems in a memo dictionary, we avoid recalculating the same values multiple times. Each subproblem is solved only once, leading to O(n*x) complexity.

### Improvement 2: Bottom-Up Dynamic Programming - O(n*x)
**Description**: Use iterative DP to build the solution from smaller subproblems.

```python
def book_shop_dp(n, x, prices, pages):
    # dp[i][j] = maximum pages using first i books with budget j
    dp = [[0] * (x + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(x + 1):
            # Don't buy current book
            dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]
            
            # Buy current book if we have enough money
            if j >= prices[i-1]:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i-1][j - prices[i-1]] + pages[i-1])
    
    return dp[n][x]
```

**Why this improvement works**: We build the solution iteratively by solving smaller subproblems first. For each book and budget, we decide whether to buy the book or not.

### Alternative: Space-Optimized DP - O(n*x)
**Description**: Use a space-optimized DP approach with only one row.

```python
def book_shop_optimized(n, x, prices, pages):
    # dp[j] = maximum pages with budget j
    dp = [0] * (x + 1)
    
    for i in range(n):
        # Process from right to left to avoid using the same book twice
        for j in range(x, prices[i] - 1, -1):
            dp[j] = max(dp[j], dp[j - prices[i]] + pages[i])
    
    return dp[x]
```

**Why this works**: We can optimize space by using only one row and processing from right to left to avoid using the same book multiple times.

## Final Optimal Solution

```python
n, x = map(int, input().split())
prices = list(map(int, input().split()))
pages = list(map(int, input().split()))

# dp[j] = maximum pages with budget j
dp = [0] * (x + 1)

for i in range(n):
    # Process from right to left to avoid using the same book twice
    for j in range(x, prices[i] - 1, -1):
        dp[j] = max(dp[j], dp[j - prices[i]] + pages[i])

print(dp[x])
```

## Notable Techniques

### 1. **Knapsack DP Pattern**

dp = [0] * (capacity + 1)
for item in items:
    for j in range(capacity, item.weight - 1, -1):
        dp[j] = max(dp[j], dp[j - item.weight] + item.value)
```

# Use single row for space optimization
dp = [0] * (capacity + 1)
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(capacity, weights[i] - 1, -1):

```

### 3. **State Transition Pattern**
```python
# Define state transitions for knapsack
dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i-1][j-weight] + value)
```

## Edge Cases to Remember

1. **x = 0**: Return 0 (no money to spend)
2. **n = 0**: Return 0 (no books available)
3. **All books too expensive**: Return 0
4. **Large x**: Use efficient DP approach
5. **Negative values**: Handle properly

## Problem-Solving Framework

1. **Identify knapsack nature**: This is a 0/1 knapsack problem
2. **Define state**: dp[j] = maximum pages with budget j
3. **Define transitions**: dp[j] = max(dp[j], dp[j-price] + pages)
4. **Handle base case**: dp[0] = 0
5. **Use space optimization**: Process from right to left
