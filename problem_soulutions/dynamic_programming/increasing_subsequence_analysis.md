# Increasing Subsequence

## Problem Description

**Problem**: Given an array of n integers, find the length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS). A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from the array by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

**Input**: 
- n: size of the array
- a1, a2, ..., an: the array elements

**Output**: Length of the longest increasing subsequence.

**Example**:
```
Input:
8
7 3 5 3 6 2 9 8

Output:
4

Explanation: 
The longest increasing subsequence is [3, 5, 6, 9] with length 4.
Other valid LIS include [3, 5, 6, 8] and [3, 3, 6, 9].
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Solution Progression

### Step 1: Understanding the Problem
**What are we trying to do?**
- Find the longest subsequence where elements are strictly increasing
- Elements must appear in the same order as in the original array
- We can skip elements but cannot reorder them
- Use dynamic programming for efficiency

**Key Observations:**
- For each position, we can either include or skip the current element
- If we include an element, it must be greater than the previous element
- This is a classic dynamic programming problem
- Can use 1D or 2D DP approach

### Step 2: Dynamic Programming Approach
**Idea**: Use 1D DP array to store LIS ending at each position.

```python
def increasing_subsequence_dp(n, arr):
    # dp[i] = length of LIS ending at position i
    dp = [1] * n
    
    for i in range(1, n):
        for j in range(i):
            if arr[i] > arr[j]:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
    
    return max(dp)
```

**Why this works:**
- Uses optimal substructure property
- Handles all cases correctly
- Efficient implementation
- O(nÂ²) time complexity

### Step 3: Complete Solution
**Putting it all together:**

```python
def solve_increasing_subsequence():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # dp[i] = length of LIS ending at position i
    dp = [1] * n
    
    for i in range(1, n):
        for j in range(i):
            if arr[i] > arr[j]:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
    
    print(max(dp))

# Main execution
if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve_increasing_subsequence()
```

**Why this works:**
- Optimal dynamic programming approach
- Handles all edge cases
- Efficient implementation
- Clear and readable code

### Step 4: Testing Our Solution
**Let's verify with examples:**

```python
def test_solution():
    test_cases = [
        ([7, 3, 5, 3, 6, 2, 9, 8], 4),
        ([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 5),
        ([5, 4, 3, 2, 1], 1),
        ([1], 1),
        ([1, 1, 1, 1], 1),
    ]
    
    for arr, expected in test_cases:
        result = solve_test(arr)
        print(f"arr={arr}, expected={expected}, result={result}")
        assert result == expected, f"Failed for arr={arr}"
        print("âœ“ Passed")
        print()

def solve_test(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    
    # dp[i] = length of LIS ending at position i
    dp = [1] * n
    
    for i in range(1, n):
        for j in range(i):
            if arr[i] > arr[j]:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
    
    return max(dp)

test_solution()
```

## ðŸ”§ Implementation Details

### Time Complexity
- **Time**: O(nÂ²) - we iterate through each position and check all previous positions
- **Space**: O(n) - we store dp array of size n

### Why This Solution Works
- **Dynamic Programming**: Efficiently computes LIS using optimal substructure
- **State Transition**: dp[i] = max(dp[j] + 1) for all j < i where arr[i] > arr[j]
- **Base Case**: dp[i] = 1 for all i (each element forms a LIS of length 1)
- **Optimal Substructure**: LIS ending at position i can be built from smaller subproblems

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Variations

### Variation 1: Print the LIS
**Problem**: Find and print the actual longest increasing subsequence.

```python
def print_longest_increasing_subsequence(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    
    # dp[i] = length of LIS ending at position i
    dp = [1] * n
    # prev[i] = previous element in LIS ending at position i
    prev = [-1] * n
    
    for i in range(1, n):
        for j in range(i):
            if arr[i] > arr[j] and dp[j] + 1 > dp[i]:
                dp[i] = dp[j] + 1
                prev[i] = j
    
    # Find the end of the longest LIS
    max_len = max(dp)
    end_pos = dp.index(max_len)
    
    # Reconstruct the LIS
    lis = []
    pos = end_pos
    while pos != -1:
        lis.append(arr[pos])
        pos = prev[pos]
    
    return lis[::-1]

# Example usage
result = print_longest_increasing_subsequence([7, 3, 5, 3, 6, 2, 9, 8])
print(f"LIS: {result}")
```

### Variation 2: Count All LIS
**Problem**: Count the number of different longest increasing subsequences.

```python
def count_longest_increasing_subsequences(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    
    # dp[i] = length of LIS ending at position i
    dp = [1] * n
    # count[i] = number of LIS ending at position i
    count = [1] * n
    
    for i in range(1, n):
        for j in range(i):
            if arr[i] > arr[j]:
                if dp[j] + 1 > dp[i]:
                    dp[i] = dp[j] + 1
                    count[i] = count[j]
                elif dp[j] + 1 == dp[i]:
                    count[i] += count[j]
    
    max_len = max(dp)
    total_count = sum(count[i] for i in range(n) if dp[i] == max_len)
    
    return total_count

# Example usage
result = count_longest_increasing_subsequences([7, 3, 5, 3, 6, 2, 9, 8])
print(f"Number of LIS: {result}")
```

### Variation 3: LIS with Constraints
**Problem**: Find LIS with additional constraints.

```python
def constrained_lis(arr, constraints):
    n = len(arr)
    
    # dp[i] = length of LIS ending at position i
    dp = [1] * n
    
    for i in range(1, n):
        for j in range(i):
            if arr[i] > arr[j] and constraints(arr[i], arr[j]):
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
    
    return max(dp)

# Example usage
def constraint_func(curr, prev):
    return curr % 2 == prev % 2  # Same parity constraint

result = constrained_lis([7, 3, 5, 3, 6, 2, 9, 8], constraint_func)
print(f"Constrained LIS length: {result}")
```

### Variation 4: LIS with Weights
**Problem**: Find LIS where each element has a weight.

```python
def weighted_lis(arr, weights):
    n = len(arr)
    
    # dp[i] = weight of LIS ending at position i
    dp = [weights[i] for i in range(n)]
    
    for i in range(1, n):
        for j in range(i):
            if arr[i] > arr[j]:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + weights[i])
    
    return max(dp)

# Example usage
weights = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
result = weighted_lis([7, 3, 5, 3, 6, 2, 9, 8], weights)
print(f"Weighted LIS: {result}")
```

### Variation 5: LIS with Dynamic Programming Optimization
**Problem**: Optimize the DP solution for better performance.

```python
def optimized_lis(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    
    # Use binary search for O(n log n) solution
    tails = []
    
    for num in arr:
        # Find position to insert num
        left, right = 0, len(tails)
        while left < right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            if tails[mid] < num:
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                right = mid
        
        if left == len(tails):
            tails.append(num)
        else:
            tails[left] = num
    
    return len(tails)

# Example usage
result = optimized_lis([7, 3, 5, 3, 6, 2, 9, 8])
print(f"Optimized LIS length: {result}")
```
