### 📚 **Prerequisites**
Before attempting this problem, ensure you understand:
- **Algorithm Knowledge**: Dynamic programming, combination counting, order constraints, bottom-up DP
- **Data Structures**: Arrays, DP tables, combination data structures
- **Mathematical Concepts**: Combinatorics, combination counting, order principles, modular arithmetic
- **Programming Skills**: Array manipulation, iterative programming, combination techniques, DP implementation
- **Related Problems**: Coin Combinations I (ordered combinations), Dice Combinations (basic counting DP), Minimizing Coins (optimization DP)

## Problem Description

**Problem**: Given a money system with n coins of different values, count the number of distinct ordered ways to produce a sum x using the available coins (order doesn't matter).

**Input**: 
- n, x: number of coins and target sum
- c1, c2, ..., cn: values of each coin

**Output**: Number of distinct ordered ways modulo 10^9+7.

**Example**:
```
Input:
3 9
2 3 5

Output:
3

Explanation: 
There are 3 distinct ordered ways to achieve sum 9:
- 2+2+5
- 3+3+3
- 2+2+2+3
Note: The order of coins doesn't matter, so 2+2+5 and 5+2+2 are considered the same.
```

## Solution Progression

### Approach 1: Recursive Brute Force - O(n^x)
**Description**: Try all possible combinations of coins recursively, ensuring no duplicates.

```python
def coin_combinations_ii_brute_force(n, x, coins):
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    
    def count_ways(target, last_coin):
        if target == 0:
            return 1
        if target < 0:
            return 0
        
        ways = 0
        for coin in coins: if coin >= 
last_coin: # Ensure non-decreasing order
                ways += count_ways(target - coin, coin)
        
        return ways % MOD
    
    return count_ways(x, 0)
```

**Why this is inefficient**: We're trying all possible combinations of coins, which leads to exponential complexity. For each target, we try all coin values, leading to O(n^x) complexity.

### Improvement 1: Recursive with Memoization - O(n*x)
**Description**: Use memoization to avoid recalculating the same subproblems.

```python
def coin_combinations_ii_memoization(n, x, coins):
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    memo = {}
    
    def count_ways(target, last_coin):
        if (target, last_coin) in memo:
            return memo[(target, last_coin)]
        
        if target == 0:
            return 1
        if target < 0:
            return 0
        
        ways = 0
        for coin in coins: if coin >= 
last_coin: # Ensure non-decreasing order
                ways += count_ways(target - coin, coin)
        
        memo[(target, last_coin)] = ways % MOD
        return memo[(target, last_coin)]
    
    return count_ways(x, 0)
```

**Why this improvement works**: By storing the results of subproblems in a memo dictionary, we avoid recalculating the same values multiple times. Each subproblem is solved only once, leading to O(n*x) complexity.

### Improvement 2: Bottom-Up Dynamic Programming - O(n*x)
**Description**: Use iterative DP to build the solution from smaller subproblems.

```python
def coin_combinations_ii_dp(n, x, coins):
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    
    # dp[i] = number of ways to make sum i (ordered)
    dp = [0] * (x + 1)
    dp[0] = 1  # Base case: one way to make sum 0 (empty combination)
    
    # Sort coins to ensure non-decreasing order
    coins.sort()
    
    for coin in coins:
        for i in range(coin, x + 1):
            dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[i - coin]) % MOD
    
    return dp[x]
```

**Why this improvement works**: We iterate through coins first, then through sums. This ensures that we only count ordered combinations (non-decreasing order).

### Step 3: Complete Solution
**Putting it all together:**

```python
def solve_coin_combinations_ii():
    n, x = map(int, input().split())
    coins = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    
    # dp[i] = number of ways to make sum i (ordered)
    dp = [0] * (x + 1)
    dp[0] = 1  # Base case: one way to make sum 0 (empty combination)
    
    # Sort coins to ensure non-decreasing order
    coins.sort()
    
    for coin in coins:
        for i in range(coin, x + 1):
            dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[i - coin]) % MOD
    
    print(dp[x])

# Main execution
if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve_coin_combinations_ii()
```

**Why this works:**
- Optimal dynamic programming approach
- Handles ordered combinations correctly
- Efficient implementation
- Clear and readable code

### Step 4: Testing Our Solution
**Let's verify with examples:**

```python
def test_solution():
    test_cases = [
        (3, 9, [2, 3, 5], 3),
        (2, 5, [1, 2], 3),
        (3, 6, [1, 2, 3], 4),
        (4, 10, [1, 2, 5, 10], 4),
    ]
    
    for n, x, coins, expected in test_cases:
        result = solve_test(n, x, coins)
        print(f"n={n}, x={x}, coins={coins}, expected={expected}, result={result}")
        assert result == expected, f"Failed for n={n}, x={x}, coins={coins}"
        print("✓ Passed")
        print()

def solve_test(n, x, coins):
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    
    # dp[i] = number of ways to make sum i (ordered)
    dp = [0] * (x + 1)
    dp[0] = 1  # Base case
    
    # Sort coins to ensure non-decreasing order
    coins.sort()
    
    for coin in coins:
        for i in range(coin, x + 1):
            dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[i - coin]) % MOD
    
    return dp[x]

test_solution()
```

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Time Complexity
- **Time**: O(n*x) - we iterate through each coin and each sum
- **Space**: O(x) - we store dp array of size x+1

### Why This Solution Works
- **Dynamic Programming**: Efficiently computes ordered combinations using optimal substructure
- **State Transition**: dp[i] = sum of dp[i-coin] for all valid coins (in order)
- **Base Case**: dp[0] = 1 represents empty combination
- **Ordering**: Sorting coins ensures non-decreasing order

## 🎨 Visual Example

### Input Example
```
n = 3, x = 9
Coins: [2, 3, 5]
```

### All Possible Ordered Combinations
```
Coins: [2, 3, 5]
Target: 9

All ordered combinations (order doesn't matter):
1. 2+2+5 = 9
2. 3+3+3 = 9
3. 2+2+2+3 = 9

Note: 2+2+5 and 5+2+2 are considered the same (order doesn't matter)
```

### DP State Representation
```
dp[i] = number of ordered ways to make sum i

For coins [2, 3, 5] and target 9:
dp[0] = 1 (empty combination)

After processing coin 2:
dp[0] = 1, dp[2] = 1, dp[4] = 1, dp[6] = 1, dp[8] = 1

After processing coin 3:
dp[0] = 1, dp[2] = 1, dp[3] = 1, dp[4] = 1, dp[5] = 1, dp[6] = 2, dp[7] = 1, dp[8] = 1, dp[9] = 1

After processing coin 5:
dp[0] = 1, dp[2] = 1, dp[3] = 1, dp[4] = 1, dp[5] = 2, dp[6] = 2, dp[7] = 2, dp[8] = 2, dp[9] = 3
```

### DP Table Construction
```
Coins: [2, 3, 5]
Target: 9

Step 1: Initialize
dp[0] = 1

Step 2: Process coin 2
dp[2] = dp[0] = 1
dp[4] = dp[2] = 1
dp[6] = dp[4] = 1
dp[8] = dp[6] = 1

Step 3: Process coin 3
dp[3] = dp[0] = 1
dp[5] = dp[2] = 1
dp[6] = dp[3] = 1 (but dp[6] already 1, so dp[6] = 1)
dp[7] = dp[4] = 1
dp[8] = dp[5] = 1
dp[9] = dp[6] = 1

Step 4: Process coin 5
dp[5] = dp[0] = 1 (but dp[5] already 1, so dp[5] = 1)
dp[6] = dp[1] = 0 (but dp[6] already 1, so dp[6] = 1)
dp[7] = dp[2] = 1 (but dp[7] already 1, so dp[7] = 1)
dp[8] = dp[3] = 1 (but dp[8] already 1, so dp[8] = 1)
dp[9] = dp[4] = 1 (but dp[9] already 1, so dp[9] = 1)

Wait, let me recalculate:
dp[5] = dp[0] = 1 (but dp[5] already 1, so dp[5] = 1)
dp[6] = dp[1] = 0 (but dp[6] already 1, so dp[6] = 1)
dp[7] = dp[2] = 1 (but dp[7] already 1, so dp[7] = 1)
dp[8] = dp[3] = 1 (but dp[8] already 1, so dp[8] = 1)
dp[9] = dp[4] = 1 (but dp[9] already 1, so dp[9] = 1)

Actually, the correct calculation:
dp[5] = dp[0] = 1 (but dp[5] already 1, so dp[5] = 1)
dp[6] = dp[1] = 0 (but dp[6] already 1, so dp[6] = 1)
dp[7] = dp[2] = 1 (but dp[7] already 1, so dp[7] = 1)
dp[8] = dp[3] = 1 (but dp[8] already 1, so dp[8] = 1)
dp[9] = dp[4] = 1 (but dp[9] already 1, so dp[9] = 1)

Final result: dp[9] = 1
```

### Visual DP Table
```
Coins: [2, 3, 5]
Target: 9

DP Table (ordered ways):
Sum:  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9
Ways: 1  0  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1

Each cell shows number of ordered ways to make that sum

## 🎯 Problem Variations

### Variation 1: Ordered Combinations with Limited Supply
**Problem**: Each coin has a limited number available.

```python
def coin_combinations_ii_limited_supply(n, x, coins, quantities):
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    
    # dp[i] = number of ways to make sum i (ordered)
    dp = [0] * (x + 1)
    dp[0] = 1  # Base case
    
    # Sort coins to ensure non-decreasing order
    sorted_coins = sorted(zip(coins, quantities))
    
    for coin, quantity in sorted_coins:
        for i in range(x, coin - 1, -1):  # Reverse order to avoid overcounting
            for k in range(1, quantity + 1):
                if i >= k * coin:
                    dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[i - k * coin]) % MOD
    
    return dp[x]

# Example usage
coins = [2, 3, 5]
quantities = [3, 2, 1]  # 3 coins of value 2, 2 coins of value 3, 1 coin of value 5
result = coin_combinations_ii_limited_supply(3, 9, coins, quantities)
print(f"Ordered ways to make sum 9: {result}")
```

### Variation 2: Ordered Combinations with Constraints
**Problem**: Cannot use certain combinations of coins.

```python
def coin_combinations_ii_with_constraints(n, x, coins, forbidden_combinations):
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    
    # dp[i][mask] = ways to make sum i with used coins mask (ordered)
    dp = [[0] * (1 << n) for _ in range(x + 1)]
    dp[0][0] = 1  # Base case
    
    # Sort coins to ensure non-decreasing order
    sorted_coins = sorted(enumerate(coins), key=lambda x: x[1])
    
    for idx, coin in sorted_coins:
        for i in range(coin, x + 1):
            for mask in range(1 << n):
                if dp[i - coin][mask] > 0:
                    new_mask = mask | (1 << idx)
                    if new_mask not in forbidden_combinations:
                        dp[i][new_mask] = (dp[i][new_mask] + dp[i - coin][mask]) % MOD
    
    return sum(dp[x]) % MOD

# Example usage
coins = [2, 3, 5]
forbidden = {0b110}  # Cannot use coins 1 and 3 together
result = coin_combinations_ii_with_constraints(3, 9, coins, forbidden)
print(f"Ordered ways to make sum 9: {result}")
```

### Variation 3: Ordered Combinations with Weights
**Problem**: Each coin has a weight, find weighted ordered combinations.

```python
def coin_combinations_ii_weighted(n, x, coins, weights):
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    
    # dp[i] = weighted sum of ordered ways to make sum i
    dp = [0] * (x + 1)
    dp[0] = 1  # Base case
    
    # Sort coins to ensure non-decreasing order
    sorted_coins = sorted(zip(coins, weights), key=lambda x: x[0])
    
    for coin, weight in sorted_coins:
        for i in range(coin, x + 1):
            dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[i - coin] * weight) % MOD
    
    return dp[x]

# Example usage
coins = [2, 3, 5]
weights = [2, 3, 1]  # weight of each coin
result = coin_combinations_ii_weighted(3, 9, coins, weights)
print(f"Weighted ordered ways to make sum 9: {result}")
```

### Variation 4: Ordered Combinations with Probability
**Problem**: Each coin has a probability of success.

```python
def coin_combinations_ii_probability(n, x, coins, probabilities):
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    
    # dp[i] = expected number of ordered ways to make sum i
    dp = [0.0] * (x + 1)
    dp[0] = 1.0  # Base case
    
    # Sort coins to ensure non-decreasing order
    sorted_coins = sorted(zip(coins, probabilities), key=lambda x: x[0])
    
    for coin, prob in sorted_coins:
        for i in range(coin, x + 1):
            dp[i] += dp[i - coin] * prob
    
    return dp[x]

# Example usage
coins = [2, 3, 5]
probabilities = [0.9, 0.8, 0.7]  # probability of each coin being valid
result = coin_combinations_ii_probability(3, 9, coins, probabilities)
print(f"Expected ordered ways to make sum 9: {result}")
```

### Variation 5: Ordered Combinations with Dynamic Programming Optimization
**Problem**: Optimize the DP solution for better performance.

```python
def coin_combinations_ii_optimized(n, x, coins):
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    
    # Sort coins for better performance and ordering
    coins.sort()
    
    # dp[i] = number of ways to make sum i (ordered)
    dp = [0] * (x + 1)
    dp[0] = 1  # Base case
    
    # Use early termination and better memory access
    for coin in coins:
        for i in range(coin, x + 1):
            dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[i - coin]) % MOD
    
    return dp[x]

# Example usage
coins = [5, 3, 2]  # Unsorted
result = coin_combinations_ii_optimized(3, 9, coins)
print(f"Ordered ways to make sum 9: {result}")
```

**This is a great introduction to dynamic programming for ordered counting problems!** 🎯

```python
def coin_combinations_ii_dp(n, x, coins):
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    
    # Sort coins to ensure non-decreasing order
    coins.sort()
    
    # dp[i] = number of ways to make sum i
    dp = [0] * (x + 1)
    dp[0] = 1  # Base case: one way to make sum 0 (empty combination)
    
    # Process coins in order to avoid duplicates
    for coin in coins:
        for i in range(coin, x + 1):
            dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[i - coin]) % MOD
    
    return dp[x]
```

**Why this improvement works**: We process coins in sorted order and build the solution iteratively. By processing each coin separately, we ensure that we don't count the same combination multiple times.

### Alternative: 2D DP Approach - O(n*x)
**Description**: Use a 2D DP approach to explicitly track coin usage.

```python
def coin_combinations_ii_2d_dp(n, x, coins):
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    
    # dp[i][j] = number of ways to make sum i using coins up to index j
    dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(x + 1)]
    dp[0][0] = 1  # Base case
    
    for i in range(x + 1):
        for j in range(n):
            if i == 0:
                dp[i][j] = 1
            elif j == 0:
                if i % coins[0] == 0:
                    dp[i][j] = 1
            else:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1]  # Don't use current coin
                if i >= coins[j]:
                    dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j] + dp[i - coins[j]][j]) % MOD
    
    return dp[x][n-1]
```

**Why this works**: This approach explicitly tracks which coins are used, ensuring we don't count duplicates.

## Final Optimal Solution

```python
n, x = map(int, input().split())
coins = list(map(int, input().split()))
MOD = 10**9 + 7

# Sort coins to ensure non-decreasing order
coins.sort()

# dp[i] = number of ways to make sum i
dp = [0] * (x + 1)
dp[0] = 1  # Base case

# Process coins in order to avoid duplicates
for coin in coins:
    for i in range(coin, x + 1):
        dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[i - coin]) % MOD

print(dp[x])
```

    for i in range(x + 1):
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1]  # Don't use coin j

                if i >= coin and j > 0:
                    dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j] + dp[i - coin][j - 1]) % MOD
    
    # Sum all ways with at least min_coins
    result = 0
    for j in range(min_coins, x + 1):

    dp = [[0] * (max_coins + 1) for _ in range(x + 1)]
    dp[0][0] = 1  # Base case
    
    for i in range(x + 1):
        for j in range(max_coins + 1):
            for coin in coins:
                if i >= coin and j > 0:
                    dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j] + dp[i - coin][j - 1]) % MOD
    
    # Sum all ways with at most max_coins
    result = 0
    for j in range(max_coins + 1):
        result = (result + dp[x][j]) % MOD
    
    return result
```

    # costs[i] = cost of using coin i
    
    # dp[i] = minimum cost to make sum i
    dp = [float('inf')] * (x + 1)
    dp[0] = 0  # Base case
    
    for i in range(1, x + 1):
        for j, coin in enumerate(coins):
            if i >= coin:
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], costs[j] + dp[i - coin])
    
    return dp[x] if dp[x] != float('inf') else -1
```

#### **Variation 5: Coin Combinations with Probabilities**
**Problem**: Each coin has a probability of being used, find expected number of combinations.
```python
def coin_combinations_ii_with_probabilities(n, x, coins, probabilities):
    # probabilities[i] = probability of using coin i
    
    # dp[i] = expected number of ways to make sum i
    dp = [0.0] * (x + 1)
    dp[0] = 1.0  # Base case
    
    for i in range(1, x + 1):
        for j, coin in enumerate(coins):
            if i >= coin:
                dp[i] += dp[i - coin] * probabilities[j]
    
    return dp[x]
```
