# Grid Paths

## Problem Statement
Consider an nÃ—n grid whose squares may have traps. It is not allowed to move to a square with a trap.

Your task is to calculate the number of paths from the upper-left square to the lower-right square. You can only move right or down.

### Input
The first input line has an integer n: the size of the grid."
After this, there are n lines that describe the grid. Each line has n characters: "." denotes an empty cell, and "*" denotes a trap.

### Output
Print the number of paths modulo 10^9+7.

### Constraints
- 1 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 1000

### Example
```
Input:
4
....
.*..
...*
*...

Output:
3
```

## Solution Progression

### Approach 1: Recursive Brute Force - O(2^(nÂ²))
**Description**: Try all possible paths recursively.

```python
def grid_paths_brute_force(n, grid):
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    
    def count_paths(row, col):
        if row == n-1 and col == n-1:
            return 1
        if row >= n or col >= n or grid[row][col] == '*':
            return 0
        
        # Move right and down
        right = count_paths(row, col + 1)
        down = count_paths(row + 1, col)
        
        return (right + down) % MOD
    
    return count_paths(0, 0)
```

**Why this is inefficient**: We're trying all possible paths, which leads to exponential complexity. For each position, we have 2 choices (right or down), leading to O(2^(nÂ²)) complexity.

### Improvement 1: Recursive with Memoization - O(nÂ²)
**Description**: Use memoization to avoid recalculating the same subproblems.

```python
def grid_paths_memoization(n, grid):
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    memo = {}
    
    def count_paths(row, col):
        if (row, col) in memo:
            return memo[(row, col)]
        
        if row == n-1 and col == n-1:
            return 1
        if row >= n or col >= n or grid[row][col] == '*':
            return 0
        
        # Move right and down
        right = count_paths(row, col + 1)
        down = count_paths(row + 1, col)
        
        memo[(row, col)] = (right + down) % MOD
        return memo[(row, col)]
    
    return count_paths(0, 0)
```

**Why this improvement works**: By storing the results of subproblems in a memo dictionary, we avoid recalculating the same values multiple times. Each subproblem is solved only once, leading to O(nÂ²) complexity.

### Improvement 2: Bottom-Up Dynamic Programming - O(nÂ²)
**Description**: Use iterative DP to build the solution from smaller subproblems.

```python
def grid_paths_dp(n, grid):
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    
    # dp[i][j] = number of paths from (0,0) to (i,j)
    dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
    
    # Base case: starting position
    if grid[0][0] != '*':
        dp[0][0] = 1
    
    # Fill first row
    for j in range(1, n):
        if grid[0][j] != '*':
            dp[0][j] = dp[0][j-1]
    
    # Fill first column
    for i in range(1, n):
        if grid[i][0] != '*':
            dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][0]
    
    # Fill rest of the grid
    for i in range(1, n):
        for j in range(1, n):
            if grid[i][j] != '*':
                dp[i][j] = (dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1]) % MOD
    
    return dp[n-1][n-1]
```

**Why this improvement works**: We build the solution iteratively by solving smaller subproblems first. For each cell, we add the paths from the cell above and the cell to the left.

### Alternative: Optimized DP with Boundary Handling - O(nÂ²)
**Description**: Use a more efficient DP approach with better boundary handling.

```python
def grid_paths_optimized(n, grid):
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    
    # dp[i][j] = number of paths from (0,0) to (i,j)
    dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
    
    # Initialize with boundary conditions
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if grid[i][j] == '*':
                dp[i][j] = 0
            elif i == 0 and j == 0:
                dp[i][j] = 1
            elif i == 0:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1]
            elif j == 0:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]
            else:
                dp[i][j] = (dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1]) % MOD
    
    return dp[n-1][n-1]
```

**Why this works**: This approach handles all boundary conditions in a single loop, making it more concise and efficient.

## Final Optimal Solution

```python
n = int(input())
grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]
MOD = 10**9 + 7

# dp[i][j] = number of paths from (0,0) to (i,j)
dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]

# Base case: starting position
if grid[0][0] != '*':
    dp[0][0] = 1

# Fill first row
for j in range(1, n):
    if grid[0][j] != '*':
        dp[0][j] = dp[0][j-1]

# Fill first column
for i in range(1, n):
    if grid[i][0] != '*':
        dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][0]

# Fill rest of the grid
for i in range(1, n):
    for j in range(1, n):
        if grid[i][j] != '*':
            dp[i][j] = (dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1]) % MOD

print(dp[n-1][n-1])
```

dp[0][0] = 1  # Base case
```

for i in range(n):
    for j in range(n):
        if condition:
            dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1]
```

### 3. **Boundary Handling Pattern**

# Handle boundary conditions
if i == 0 and j == 0:
    dp[i][j] = 1
elif i == 0:
    dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1]
elif j == 0:
    dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]
else:
    dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1]
```

## Edge Cases to Remember

1. **n = 1**: Handle single cell grid
2. **All cells are traps**: Return 0
3. **Start or end is trap**: Return 0
4. **Large grid**: Use efficient DP approach
5. **Boundary conditions**: Handle first row and column separately

## Problem-Solving Framework

1. **Identify grid nature**: This is a grid-based path counting problem
2. **Define state**: dp[i][j] = number of paths to (i,j)
3. **Define transitions**: dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1]
4. **Handle base case**: dp[0][0] = 1
5. **Handle traps**: Set dp[i][j] = 0 for trap cells
