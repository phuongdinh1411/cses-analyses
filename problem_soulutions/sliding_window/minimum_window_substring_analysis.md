## üìã Problem Description

Given two strings s and t, find the minimum window substring of s that contains all characters of t.

**Input**: 
- First line: string s
- Second line: string t

**Output**: 
- Single string: minimum window substring of s that contains all characters of t

**Constraints**:
- 1 ‚â§ |s| ‚â§ 10‚Åµ
- 1 ‚â§ |t| ‚â§ 10‚Åµ
- s and t contain only lowercase English letters

**Example**:
```
Input:
ADOBECODEBANC
ABC

Output:
BANC

Explanation**: 
The minimum window substring that contains all characters of "ABC" is "BANC".
```

## üîç Solution Analysis: From Brute Force to Optimal

### Approach 1: Brute Force
**Time Complexity**: O(n¬≥)  
**Space Complexity**: O(n)

**Algorithm**:
1. For each starting position i from 0 to n-1
2. For each ending position j from i to n-1
3. Check if substring from i to j contains all characters of t
4. If yes, update minimum window
5. Return minimum window

**Implementation**:
```python
def brute_force_minimum_window_substring(s, t):
    n = len(s)
    min_window = ""
    min_length = float('inf')
    
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i, n):
            substring = s[i:j+1]
            if contains_all_characters(substring, t):
                if len(substring) < min_length:
                    min_length = len(substring)
                    min_window = substring
    
    return min_window

def contains_all_characters(s, t):
    char_count = {}
    for char in t:
        char_count[char] = char_count.get(char, 0) + 1
    
    for char in s:
        if char in char_count:
            char_count[char] -= 1
            if char_count[char] == 0:
                del char_count[char]
    
    return len(char_count) == 0
```

### Approach 2: Optimized with Hash Map
**Time Complexity**: O(n¬≤)  
**Space Complexity**: O(n)

**Algorithm**:
1. For each starting position i from 0 to n-1
2. Use hash map to track characters from position i
3. For each ending position j from i to n-1
4. Add s[j] to hash map
5. If hash map contains all characters of t, update minimum window
6. Return minimum window

**Implementation**:
```python
def optimized_minimum_window_substring(s, t):
    n = len(s)
    min_window = ""
    min_length = float('inf')
    
    for i in range(n):
        char_count = {}
        for j in range(i, n):
            char_count[s[j]] = char_count.get(s[j], 0) + 1
            if contains_all_characters(char_count, t):
                if j - i + 1 < min_length:
                    min_length = j - i + 1
                    min_window = s[i:j+1]
    
    return min_window

def contains_all_characters(char_count, t):
    for char in t:
        if char not in char_count or char_count[char] == 0:
            return False
    return True
```

### Approach 3: Optimal with Two Pointers
**Time Complexity**: O(n)  
**Space Complexity**: O(n)

**Algorithm**:
1. Use two pointers: left and right
2. Use hash map to track frequency of characters in current window
3. Expand right pointer while maintaining character coverage
4. When all characters covered, contract left pointer to minimize window
5. Update minimum window throughout
6. Return minimum window

**Implementation**:
```python
def optimal_minimum_window_substring(s, t):
    n = len(s)
    min_window = ""
    min_length = float('inf')
    
    # Count characters in t
    t_count = {}
    for char in t:
        t_count[char] = t_count.get(char, 0) + 1
    
    left = 0
    window_count = {}
    required = len(t_count)
    formed = 0
    
    for right in range(n):
        # Add character to window
        char = s[right]
        window_count[char] = window_count.get(char, 0) + 1
        
        # Check if character count matches requirement
        if char in t_count and window_count[char] == t_count[char]:
            formed += 1
        
        # Try to contract window
        while left <= right and formed == required:
            # Update minimum window
            if right - left + 1 < min_length:
                min_length = right - left + 1
                min_window = s[left:right+1]
            
            # Remove character from window
            char = s[left]
            window_count[char] -= 1
            if char in t_count and window_count[char] < t_count[char]:
                formed -= 1
            left += 1
    
    return min_window
```

## üîß Implementation Details

| Approach | Time Complexity | Space Complexity | Key Insight |
|----------|----------------|------------------|-------------|
| Brute Force | O(n¬≥) | O(n) | Check all possible substrings |
| Optimized | O(n¬≤) | O(n) | Use hash map for faster character check |
| Optimal | O(n) | O(n) | Use two pointers with hash map |

### Time Complexity
- **Time**: O(n) - Each character is processed at most twice
- **Space**: O(n) - Hash map for character frequencies

### Why This Solution Works
- **Two Pointers**: Use left and right pointers to maintain a sliding window
- **Hash Map Tracking**: Track frequency of characters in current window
- **Window Management**: Expand when not all characters covered, contract when all covered
- **Optimal Approach**: O(n) time complexity is optimal for this problem
