┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Segment 1: (0,0) to (1,1)          │
│ Segment 2: (1,1) to (2,0)          │
│ Segment 3: (2,0) to (3,1)          │
│                                   │
│ Connections:                       │
│ - Segment 1 connects to Segment 2  │
│ - Segment 2 connects to Segment 3  │
│                                   │
│ Trace: (0,0) → (1,1) → (2,0) → (3,1) │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Implementation**:
```python
def brute_force_line_segments_trace(n, segments):
    """Trace line segments using brute force approach"""
    def segments_connect(seg1, seg2):
        x1, y1, x2, y2 = seg1
        x3, y3, x4, y4 = seg2
        return (x2, y2) == (x3, y3) or (x2, y2) == (x4, y4) or \
               (x1, y1) == (x3, y3) or (x1, y1) == (x4, y4)
    
    # Build adjacency list
    adj = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            if segments_connect(segments[i], segments[j]):
                adj[i].append(j)
                adj[j].append(i)
    
    # Find starting segment
    start = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if len(adj[i]) == 1:
            start = i
            break
    
    # Trace path
    path = []
    visited = [False] * n
    current = start
    
    while current != -1:
        visited[current] = True
        x1, y1, x2, y2 = segments[current]
        
        if not path:
            path.append((x1, y1))
            path.append((x2, y2))
        else:
            if (x1, y1) == path[-1]:
                path.append((x2, y2))
            else:
                path.append((x1, y1))
        
        # Find next segment
        next_seg = -1
        for neighbor in adj[current]:
            if not visited[neighbor]:
                next_seg = neighbor
                break

│ - (2,0) connects to (3,1)          │
│                                   │
│ Traversal:                         │
│ - Start at (0,0)                   │
│ - Follow connections               │
│ - Build path: (0,0) → (1,1) → (2,0) → (3,1) │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Implementation**:
```python
def graph_traversal_line_segments_trace(n, segments):
    """Trace line segments using graph traversal approach"""
    # Build graph from segments
    graph = {}
    for i, (x1, y1, x2, y2) in enumerate(segments):
        if (x1, y1) not in graph:
            graph[(x1, y1)] = []
        if (x2, y2) not in graph:
            graph[(x2, y2)] = []
        
        graph[(x1, y1)].append((x2, y2))
        graph[(x2, y2)].append((x1, y1))
    
    # Find starting point
    start = None
    for point, neighbors in graph.items():
        if len(neighbors) == 1:
            start = point
            break
    
    if start is None:
        return []
    
    # Traverse graph to build path
    path = [start]
    visited = {start}
    current = start
    
    while current in graph:
        next_point = None
        for neighbor in graph[current]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                next_point = neighbor
                break
        
        if next_point is None:
            break
        
        path.append(next_point)
        visited.add(next_point)
        current = next_point
    
    return path

        graph[(x1, y1)].append((x2, y2))
        graph[(x2, y2)].append((x1, y1))
    
    # Find starting point using advanced data structures
    start = None
    for point, neighbors in graph.items():
        if len(neighbors) == 1:
            start = point
            break
    
    if start is None:
        return []
    
    # Traverse graph using advanced data structures
    path = [start]
