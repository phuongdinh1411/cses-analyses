## Problem Description

**Problem**: Given a set of line segments and a starting point, trace a path by following the line segments and find the final position.

**Input**: 
- n: number of line segments
- n lines: x1 y1 x2 y2 (line segment endpoints)
- start_x start_y: starting position
- direction: initial direction (0=right, 1=up, 2=left, 3=down)

**Output**: Final position (x, y) after tracing all line segments.

**Constraints**:
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000
- -1000 ≤ x1, y1, x2, y2 ≤ 1000 for all coordinates
- Line segments are connected (end of one is start of next)
- Direction is one of: 0 (right), 1 (up), 2 (left), 3 (down)
- All coordinates are integers

**Example**:
```
Input:
3
0 0 2 0    # Line segment from (0,0) to (2,0)
2 0 2 2    # Line segment from (2,0) to (2,2)
2 2 0 2    # Line segment from (2,2) to (0,2)
0 0 0       # Start at (0,0), direction right

Output:
0 2

Explanation: 
Starting at (0,0) facing right:
1. Follow line (0,0) to (2,0) → reach (2,0)
2. Follow line (2,0) to (2,2) → reach (2,2)  
3. Follow line (2,2) to (0,2) → reach (0,2)
Final position: (0,2)
```

## 🔍 Solution Analysis: From Brute Force to Optimal

### Approach 1: Recursive Path Following (Inefficient)

**Key Insights from Recursive Path Following Solution:**
- Use recursion to explore all possible paths through line segments
- Try all possible directions at each segment endpoint
- Backtrack when reaching dead ends or invalid positions
- Return the final position after exploring all valid paths

**Algorithm:**
1. Start from current position with current direction
2. If no more segments to follow, return current position
3. For each possible next segment:
   - If current position matches segment start, recursively follow
   - Try all possible directions at segment endpoints
   - Backtrack if path becomes invalid
4. Return the final position from the valid path

**Visual Example:**
```
Y
2 | +---+---+
1 | |   |   |
0 | +---+---+
  +---+---+---+
    0   1   2  X

Recursive exploration from (0,0):
- Try segment 1: (0,0) to (2,0) → reach (2,0)
- Try segment 2: (2,0) to (2,2) → reach (2,2)
- Try segment 3: (2,2) to (0,2) → reach (0,2)
```

**Implementation:**
```python
def line_segments_trace_recursive(segments, start_x, start_y, direction, visited_segments=None):
    if visited_segments is None:
        visited_segments = set()
    
    current_x, current_y = start_x, start_y
    current_direction = direction
    
    # Base case: no more segments to follow
    if len(visited_segments) == len(segments):
        return current_x, current_y
    
    # Try each unvisited segment
    for i, (x1, y1, x2, y2) in enumerate(segments):
        if i in visited_segments:
            continue
            
        if (current_x, current_y) == (x1, y1):
            # Follow this segment
            visited_segments.add(i)
            new_x, new_y = x2, y2
            
            # Update direction based on segment direction
            dx = x2 - x1
            dy = y2 - y1
            
            if dx > 0:
                new_direction = 0
            elif dx < 0:
                new_direction = 2
            elif dy > 0:
                new_direction = 1
            elif dy < 0:
                new_direction = 3
            
            # Recursively continue
            result = line_segments_trace_recursive(
                segments, new_x, new_y, new_direction, visited_segments.copy()
            )
            
            if result is not None:
                return result
            
            visited_segments.remove(i)
    
    return None  # No valid path found
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n!) where n is the number of segments
**Space Complexity:** O(n) for recursion stack and visited set

**Why it's inefficient:**
- Exponential time complexity due to exploring all possible paths
- Redundant calculations for the same segment combinations
- No memoization to avoid repeated work

### Approach 2: Sequential Following (Better)

**Key Insights from Sequential Following Solution:**
- Follow line segments in the order they are given
- Update position and direction after each segment
- Use simple arithmetic to determine direction changes
- Stop when all segments have been processed

**Algorithm:**
1. Initialize current position and direction
2. For each line segment in order:
   - Check if current position matches segment start
   - Move to segment end position
   - Update direction based on segment direction vector
3. Return final position

**Visual Example:**
```
Y
2 | +---+---+
1 | |   |   |
0 | +---+---+
  +---+---+---+
    0   1   2  X

Sequential following:
Step 1: (0,0) → (2,0) - direction: right
Step 2: (2,0) → (2,2) - direction: up  
Step 3: (2,2) → (0,2) - direction: left
```

**Implementation:**
```python
def line_segments_trace_sequential(segments, start_x, start_y, direction):
    current_x, current_y = start_x, start_y
    current_direction = direction
    
    for x1, y1, x2, y2 in segments:
        # Check if current position matches segment start
        if (current_x, current_y) == (x1, y1):
            # Follow segment to end
            current_x, current_y = x2, y2
            
            # Update direction based on segment direction
            dx = x2 - x1
            dy = y2 - y1
            
            if dx > 0:  # Moving right
                current_direction = 0
            elif dx < 0:  # Moving left
                current_direction = 2
            elif dy > 0:  # Moving up
                current_direction = 1
            elif dy < 0:  # Moving down
                current_direction = 3
    
    return current_x, current_y
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n) where n is the number of segments
**Space Complexity:** O(1) for tracking position and direction

**Why it's better:**
- Linear time complexity
- Simple and straightforward implementation
- Handles all valid input cases
- Efficient for the given problem constraints

### Approach 3: Optimized Vector Following (Optimal)

**Key Insights from Optimized Vector Following Solution:**
- Use vector arithmetic for efficient direction calculations
- Precompute direction vectors to avoid repeated calculations
- Use bitwise operations for direction updates when possible
- Optimize for common geometric patterns

**Algorithm:**
1. Precompute direction vectors and mapping
2. Use vector arithmetic for position updates
3. Optimize direction calculations using lookup tables
4. Handle edge cases efficiently

**Visual Example:**
```
Y
2 | +---+---+
1 | |   |   |
0 | +---+---+
  +---+---+---+
    0   1   2  X

Optimized vector following:
- Direction vectors: [(1,0), (0,1), (-1,0), (0,-1)]
- Vector operations: (x2-x1, y2-y1) → direction index
- Lookup table: {(+1,0): 0, (0,+1): 1, (-1,0): 2, (0,-1): 3}
```

**Implementation:**
```python
def line_segments_trace_optimized(segments, start_x, start_y, direction):
    # Precompute direction mapping for efficiency
    direction_map = {
        (1, 0): 0,   # right
        (0, 1): 1,   # up
        (-1, 0): 2,  # left
        (0, -1): 3   # down
    }
    
    current_x, current_y = start_x, start_y
    current_direction = direction
    
    for x1, y1, x2, y2 in segments:
        if (current_x, current_y) == (x1, y1):
            # Update position
            current_x, current_y = x2, y2
            
            # Calculate direction vector
            dx = x2 - x1
            dy = y2 - y1
            
            # Use lookup table for direction update
            if (dx, dy) in direction_map:
                current_direction = direction_map[(dx, dy)]
            else:
                # Handle diagonal or zero-length segments
                if dx == 0 and dy == 0:
                    continue  # Zero-length segment
                else:
                    # Normalize direction for non-cardinal segments
                    if abs(dx) > abs(dy):
                        current_direction = 0 if dx > 0 else 2
                    else:
                        current_direction = 1 if dy > 0 else 3
    
    return current_x, current_y
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n) where n is the number of segments
**Space Complexity:** O(1) for lookup table and variables

**Why it's optimal:**
- Linear time complexity with optimized operations
- Uses lookup tables for fast direction calculations
- Handles edge cases efficiently
- Minimal memory usage with precomputed values

                    break
            
            if not path_blocked:
                current_x, current_y = x2, y2
                
                dx = x2 - x1
                dy = y2 - y1
                
                if dx > 0:
                    current_direction = 0
                elif dx < 0:
                    current_direction = 2

```python
def line_segments_trace_shortest_path(segments, start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y):
    from collections import deque
    
    # Build adjacency list from segments
    graph = {}
    for x1, y1, x2, y2 in segments:
        if (x1, y1) not in graph:
            graph[(x1, y1)] = []
