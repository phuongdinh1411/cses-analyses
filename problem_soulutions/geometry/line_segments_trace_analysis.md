## Problem Description

**Problem**: Given a set of line segments and a starting point, trace a path by following the line segments and find the final position.

**Input**: 
- n: number of line segments
- n lines: x1 y1 x2 y2 (line segment endpoints)
- start_x start_y: starting position
- direction: initial direction (0=right, 1=up, 2=left, 3=down)

**Output**: Final position (x, y) after tracing all line segments.

**Example**:
```
Input:
3
0 0 2 0    # Line segment from (0,0) to (2,0)
2 0 2 2    # Line segment from (2,0) to (2,2)
2 2 0 2    # Line segment from (2,2) to (0,2)
0 0 0       # Start at (0,0), direction right

Output:
0 2

Explanation: 
Starting at (0,0) facing right:
1. Follow line (0,0) to (2,0) → reach (2,0)
2. Follow line (2,0) to (2,2) → reach (2,2)  
3. Follow line (2,2) to (0,2) → reach (0,2)
Final position: (0,2)
```

## 🎯 Solution Progression

### Step 1: Understanding the Problem
**What are we trying to do?**
- Trace a path following line segments
- Handle direction changes at segment endpoints
- Find final position after tracing
- Apply geometric path following algorithms

**Key Observations:**
- Need to follow line segments in sequence
- Direction changes at segment endpoints
- Can use vector operations for movement
- Need to handle direction updates

### Step 2: Line Segment Tracing Approach
**Idea**: Follow each line segment sequentially, updating position and direction.

```python
def line_segments_trace_tracing(n, segments, start_x, start_y, direction):
    # Direction vectors: right, up, left, down
    directions = [(1, 0), (0, 1), (-1, 0), (0, -1)]
    
    current_x, current_y = start_x, start_y
    current_direction = direction
    
    for x1, y1, x2, y2 in segments:
        # Check if current position matches segment start
        if (current_x, current_y) == (x1, y1):
            # Follow segment to end
            current_x, current_y = x2, y2
            
            # Update direction based on segment direction
            dx = x2 - x1
            dy = y2 - y1
            
            if dx > 0:  # Moving right
                current_direction = 0
            elif dx < 0:  # Moving left
                current_direction = 2
            elif dy > 0:  # Moving up
                current_direction = 1
            elif dy < 0:  # Moving down
                current_direction = 3
    
    return current_x, current_y
```

**Why this works:**
- Follows segments sequentially
- Updates direction at each endpoint
- Handles all movement types
- O(n) time complexity

### Step 3: Complete Solution
**Putting it all together:**

```python
def solve_line_segments_trace():
    n = int(input())
    segments = []
    
    for _ in range(n):
        x1, y1, x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())
        segments.append((x1, y1, x2, y2))
    
    start_x, start_y, direction = map(int, input().split())
    
    final_x, final_y = trace_line_segments(segments, start_x, start_y, direction)
    print(final_x, final_y)

def trace_line_segments(segments, start_x, start_y, direction):
    current_x, current_y = start_x, start_y
    current_direction = direction
    
    for x1, y1, x2, y2 in segments:
        # Check if current position matches segment start
        if (current_x, current_y) == (x1, y1):
            # Follow segment to end
            current_x, current_y = x2, y2
            
            # Update direction based on segment direction
            dx = x2 - x1
            dy = y2 - y1
            
            if dx > 0:  # Moving right
                current_direction = 0
            elif dx < 0:  # Moving left
                current_direction = 2
            elif dy > 0:  # Moving up
                current_direction = 1
            elif dy < 0:  # Moving down
                current_direction = 3
    
    return current_x, current_y

# Main execution
if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve_line_segments_trace()
```

**Why this works:**
- Optimal line segment tracing approach
- Handles all edge cases correctly
- Efficient implementation
- Clear and readable code

### Step 4: Testing Our Solution
**Let's verify with examples:**

```python
def test_solution():
    test_cases = [
        (3, [(0, 0, 2, 0), (2, 0, 2, 2), (2, 2, 0, 2)], 
         (0, 0, 0), (0, 2)),
        (2, [(0, 0, 1, 1), (1, 1, 2, 0)], 
         (0, 0, 0), (2, 0)),
    ]
    
    for n, segments, start_info, expected in test_cases:
        start_x, start_y, direction = start_info
        result = solve_test(segments, start_x, start_y, direction)
        print(f"Segments: {segments}, Start: {start_info}")
        print(f"Expected: {expected}, Got: {result}")
        print(f"{'✓ PASS' if result == expected else '✗ FAIL'}")
        print()

def solve_test(segments, start_x, start_y, direction):
    return trace_line_segments(segments, start_x, start_y, direction)

def trace_line_segments(segments, start_x, start_y, direction):
    current_x, current_y = start_x, start_y
    current_direction = direction
    
    for x1, y1, x2, y2 in segments:
        if (current_x, current_y) == (x1, y1):
            current_x, current_y = x2, y2
            
            dx = x2 - x1
            dy = y2 - y1
            
            if dx > 0:
                current_direction = 0
            elif dx < 0:
                current_direction = 2
            elif dy > 0:
                current_direction = 1
            elif dy < 0:
                current_direction = 3
    
    return current_x, current_y

test_solution()
```

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Time Complexity
- **Time**: O(n) - process each line segment once
- **Space**: O(1) - constant space for tracking position

### Why This Solution Works
- **Sequential Tracing**: Follows segments in order
- **Direction Updates**: Updates direction at each endpoint
- **Position Tracking**: Maintains current position
- **Segment Matching**: Ensures proper segment following

## 🎨 Visual Example

### Input Example
```
3 line segments:
1. (0,0) to (2,0)
2. (2,0) to (2,2)
3. (2,2) to (0,2)
Start: (0,0), direction: right (0)
```

### Line Segments Visualization
```
Y
2 | +---+---+
1 | |   |   |
0 | +---+---+
  +---+---+---+
    0   1   2  X

Line segments:
1. (0,0) to (2,0) - horizontal
2. (2,0) to (2,2) - vertical
3. (2,2) to (0,2) - horizontal
```

### Tracing Process
```
Step 1: Start at (0,0), direction right
- Follow segment 1: (0,0) to (2,0)
- Reach (2,0)
- Direction remains right

Step 2: At (2,0), direction right
- Follow segment 2: (2,0) to (2,2)
- Reach (2,2)
- Direction changes to up

Step 3: At (2,2), direction up
- Follow segment 3: (2,2) to (0,2)
- Reach (0,2)
- Direction changes to left

Final position: (0,2)
```

### Direction Updates
```
Direction mapping:
0 = right (→)
1 = up (↑)
2 = left (←)
3 = down (↓)

At each endpoint:
- Calculate direction from current segment
- Update current direction
- Continue to next segment
```

### Path Visualization

## 🎯 Problem Variations

### Variation 1: Line Segments with Weights
**Problem**: Each line segment has a weight, find total weight of traced path.

```python
def line_segments_trace_with_weights(segments_with_weights, start_x, start_y, direction):
    current_x, current_y = start_x, start_y
    current_direction = direction
    total_weight = 0
    
    for (x1, y1, x2, y2), weight in segments_with_weights:
        if (current_x, current_y) == (x1, y1):
            current_x, current_y = x2, y2
            total_weight += weight
            
            dx = x2 - x1
            dy = y2 - y1
            
            if dx > 0:
                current_direction = 0
            elif dx < 0:
                current_direction = 2
            elif dy > 0:
                current_direction = 1
            elif dy < 0:
                current_direction = 3
    
    return current_x, current_y, total_weight

# Example usage
segments_with_weights = [((0, 0, 2, 0), 3), ((2, 0, 2, 2), 2), ((2, 2, 0, 2), 1)]
result = line_segments_trace_with_weights(segments_with_weights, 0, 0, 0)
print(f"Final position: {result[:2]}, Total weight: {result[2]}")
```

### Variation 2: Line Segments with Obstacles
**Problem**: Some line segments are blocked by obstacles.

```python
def line_segments_trace_with_obstacles(segments, obstacles, start_x, start_y, direction):
    current_x, current_y = start_x, start_y
    current_direction = direction
    
    for x1, y1, x2, y2 in segments:
        if (current_x, current_y) == (x1, y1):
            # Check if path is blocked
            path_blocked = False
            for ox, oy in obstacles:
                if point_on_line_segment(ox, oy, x1, y1, x2, y2):
                    path_blocked = True
                    break
            
            if not path_blocked:
                current_x, current_y = x2, y2
                
                dx = x2 - x1
                dy = y2 - y1
                
                if dx > 0:
                    current_direction = 0
                elif dx < 0:
                    current_direction = 2
                elif dy > 0:
                    current_direction = 1
                elif dy < 0:
                    current_direction = 3
    
    return current_x, current_y

def point_on_line_segment(px, py, x1, y1, x2, y2):
    # Check if point (px,py) lies on line segment (x1,y1) to (x2,y2)
    if x1 == x2:  # Vertical line
        return px == x1 and min(y1, y2) <= py <= max(y1, y2)
    elif y1 == y2:  # Horizontal line
        return py == y1 and min(x1, x2) <= px <= max(x1, x2)
    else:  # Diagonal line
        # Check if point lies on line and within bounds
        slope = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)
        return abs(py - y1 - slope * (px - x1)) < 1e-9 and \
               min(x1, x2) <= px <= max(x1, x2)

# Example usage
obstacles = [(1, 0), (2, 1)]
result = line_segments_trace_with_obstacles(segments, obstacles, 0, 0, 0)
print(f"Obstacle-avoiding final position: {result}")
```

### Variation 3: Line Segments with Multiple Paths
**Problem**: Find shortest path through line segments.

```python
def line_segments_trace_shortest_path(segments, start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y):
    from collections import deque
    
    # Build adjacency list from segments
    graph = {}
    for x1, y1, x2, y2 in segments:
        if (x1, y1) not in graph:
            graph[(x1, y1)] = []
        if (x2, y2) not in graph:
            graph[(x2, y2)] = []
        
        graph[(x1, y1)].append((x2, y2))
        graph[(x2, y2)].append((x1, y1))
    
    # BFS to find shortest path
    queue = deque([(start_x, start_y, 0)])  # (x, y, distance)
    visited = set()
    
    while queue:
        x, y, dist = queue.popleft()
        
        if (x, y) == (end_x, end_y):
            return dist
        
        if (x, y) in visited:
            continue
            
        visited.add((x, y))
        
        if (x, y) in graph:
            for nx, ny in graph[(x, y)]:
                if (nx, ny) not in visited:
                    queue.append((nx, ny, dist + 1))
    
    return -1  # No path found

# Example usage
result = line_segments_trace_shortest_path(segments, 0, 0, 0, 2)
print(f"Shortest path length: {result}")
```

### Variation 4: Line Segments with Dynamic Updates
**Problem**: Support adding/removing line segments and tracing.

```python
class DynamicLineSegmentsTrace:
    def __init__(self):
        self.segments = []
    
    def add_segment(self, x1, y1, x2, y2):
        self.segments.append((x1, y1, x2, y2))
    
    def remove_segment(self, x1, y1, x2, y2):
        if (x1, y1, x2, y2) in self.segments:
            self.segments.remove((x1, y1, x2, y2))
    
    def trace(self, start_x, start_y, direction):
        return trace_line_segments(self.segments, start_x, start_y, direction)

# Example usage
dynamic_trace = DynamicLineSegmentsTrace()
dynamic_trace.add_segment(0, 0, 2, 0)
dynamic_trace.add_segment(2, 0, 2, 2)
result = dynamic_trace.trace(0, 0, 0)
print(f"Dynamic trace result: {result}")
```

### Variation 5: Line Segments with Curved Paths
**Problem**: Handle curved line segments (approximated by multiple straight segments).

```python
def line_segments_trace_curved(segments, start_x, start_y, direction, curve_resolution=10):
    current_x, current_y = start_x, start_y
    current_direction = direction
    
    for x1, y1, x2, y2 in segments:
        if (current_x, current_y) == (x1, y1):
            # Approximate curve with multiple straight segments
            dx = (x2 - x1) / curve_resolution
            dy = (y2 - y1) / curve_resolution
            
            for i in range(curve_resolution):
                next_x = x1 + (i + 1) * dx
                next_y = y1 + (i + 1) * dy
                
                current_x, current_y = next_x, next_y
                
                # Update direction based on movement
                if abs(dx) > abs(dy):
                    current_direction = 0 if dx > 0 else 2
                else:
                    current_direction = 1 if dy > 0 else 3
    
    return current_x, current_y

# Example usage
result = line_segments_trace_curved(segments, 0, 0, 0, curve_resolution=5)
print(f"Curved trace result: {result}")
```
