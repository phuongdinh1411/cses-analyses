## Problem Description

**Problem**: Given a point and a line segment, determine whether the point is on the line segment, to the left, or to the right.

**Input**: 
- n: number of test cases
- n lines: x1 y1 x2 y2 px py (line segment endpoints and query point)

**Output**: For each test case, print "LEFT", "RIGHT", "ON_SEGMENT", or "ON_LINE".

**Constraints**:
- 1 ‚â§ n ‚â§ 1000
- -1000 ‚â§ x1, y1, x2, y2, px, py ‚â§ 1000 for all coordinates
- All coordinates are integers
- Line segments may have zero length (degenerate case)
- Points may be collinear with the line segment

**Example**:
```
Input:
3
0 0 2 2 1 1
0 0 2 2 3 3
0 0 2 2 0 2

Output:
ON_SEGMENT
ON_LINE
LEFT

Explanation: 
- Point (1,1) lies on the line segment from (0,0) to (2,2)
- Point (3,3) lies on the line but outside the segment
- Point (0,2) lies to the left of the line segment
```

## Visual Example

```
Y
3 |     * (3,3) - ON_LINE
2 | * (0,2) - LEFT
1 |   * (1,1) - ON_SEGMENT
0 | *
  +---+---+---+---+
    0   1   2   3  X

Line segment: (0,0) to (2,2)
Points: (1,1), (3,3), (0,2)
```

### Cross Product Results
```
Y
3 |     * (3,3) - Cross = 0, ON_LINE
2 | * (0,2) - Cross = 4, LEFT
1 |   * (1,1) - Cross = 0, ON_SEGMENT
0 | *
  +---+---+---+---+
    0   1   2   3  X

Cross product determines orientation:
- Positive: LEFT
- Negative: RIGHT  
- Zero: ON_LINE or ON_SEGMENT
```

## üîç Solution Analysis: From Brute Force to Optimal

### Approach 1: Slope Comparison (Inefficient)

**Key Insights from Slope Comparison Solution:**
- Compare slopes of line segments to determine orientation
- Use floating-point arithmetic for slope calculations
- Check if point lies within segment bounds
- Simple but prone to precision issues

**Algorithm:**
1. Calculate slope of the line segment
2. Calculate slope from segment start to query point
3. Compare slopes to determine orientation
4. Check bounds for collinear points

**Visual Example:**
```
Y
3 |     * (3,3) - Slope = 1, ON_LINE
2 | * (0,2) - Slope = 2, LEFT
1 |   * (1,1) - Slope = 1, ON_SEGMENT
0 | *
  +---+---+---+---+
    0   1   2   3  X

Line segment slope: (2-0)/(2-0) = 1
Point (1,1) slope: (1-0)/(1-0) = 1 ‚Üí ON_SEGMENT
Point (0,2) slope: (2-0)/(0-0) = ‚àû ‚Üí LEFT
```

**Implementation:**
```python
def point_location_slope_method(segment_start, segment_end, point):
    x1, y1 = segment_start
    x2, y2 = segment_end
    px, py = point
    
    # Calculate slopes
    if x2 == x1:  # Vertical line
        if px == x1:
            if min(y1, y2) <= py <= max(y1, y2):
                return "ON_SEGMENT"
            else:
                return "ON_LINE"
        else:
            return "LEFT" if px < x1 else "RIGHT"
    
    segment_slope = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)
    point_slope = (py - y1) / (px - x1)
    
    if abs(point_slope - segment_slope) < 1e-9:
        # Collinear, check bounds
        if min(x1, x2) <= px <= max(x1, x2) and min(y1, y2) <= py <= max(y1, y2):
            return "ON_SEGMENT"
        else:
            return "ON_LINE"
    elif point_slope > segment_slope:
        return "LEFT"
    else:
        return "RIGHT"
```

**Time Complexity:** O(1) per test case
**Space Complexity:** O(1) for storing slopes

**Why it's inefficient:**
- Floating-point arithmetic can cause precision issues
- Division by zero requires special handling
- Slope comparison is less robust than cross product

### Approach 2: Cross Product Method (Better)

**Key Insights from Cross Product Solution:**
- Use cross product to determine orientation directly
- Avoid floating-point arithmetic and division
- Handle all edge cases with integer arithmetic
- More robust and precise than slope method

**Algorithm:**
1. Calculate cross product of vectors AB and AC
2. Use cross product sign to determine orientation
3. For collinear points, check segment bounds
4. Return appropriate classification

**Visual Example:**
```
Y
3 |     * (3,3) - Cross = 0, ON_LINE
2 | * (0,2) - Cross = 4, LEFT
1 |   * (1,1) - Cross = 0, ON_SEGMENT
0 | *
  +---+---+---+---+
    0   1   2   3  X

Cross product formula: (x2-x1)(y3-y1) - (y2-y1)(x3-x1)
For (0,0)‚Üí(2,2) and (1,1): (2-0)(1-0) - (2-0)(1-0) = 0
```

**Implementation:**
```python
def point_location_cross_product(segment_start, segment_end, point):
    cross = cross_product(segment_start, segment_end, point)
    
    if cross > 0:
        return "LEFT"
    elif cross < 0:
        return "RIGHT"
    else:
        # Point is collinear, check if it's on segment
        if on_segment(segment_start, segment_end, point):
            return "ON_SEGMENT"
        else:
            return "ON_LINE"

def cross_product(a, b, c):
    """Calculate cross product of vectors AB and AC"""
    return (b[0] - a[0]) * (c[1] - a[1]) - (b[1] - a[1]) * (c[0] - a[0])

def on_segment(a, b, c):
    """Check if point c lies on segment ab"""
    return (min(a[0], b[0]) <= c[0] <= max(a[0], b[0]) and
            min(a[1], b[1]) <= c[1] <= max(a[1], b[1]))
```

**Time Complexity:** O(1) per test case
**Space Complexity:** O(1) for storing cross product

**Why it's better:**
- Uses integer arithmetic, avoiding precision issues
- No division by zero problems
- More robust and reliable
- Standard approach in computational geometry

### Approach 3: Optimized Cross Product with Early Termination (Optimal)

**Key Insights from Optimized Cross Product Solution:**
- Use cross product with optimized bounds checking
- Early termination for degenerate cases
- Optimize segment bounds checking
- Handle edge cases efficiently

**Algorithm:**
1. Handle degenerate line segments (zero length)
2. Calculate cross product efficiently
3. Optimize bounds checking for collinear points
4. Use early termination for common cases

**Visual Example:**
```
Y
3 |     * (3,3) - Cross = 0, bounds check: ON_LINE
2 | * (0,2) - Cross = 4, early return: LEFT
1 |   * (1,1) - Cross = 0, bounds check: ON_SEGMENT
0 | *
  +---+---+---+---+
    0   1   2   3  X

Optimized approach:
- Early return for non-zero cross products
- Efficient bounds checking for collinear points
- Handle degenerate segments
```

**Implementation:**
```python
def point_location_optimized(segment_start, segment_end, point):
    x1, y1 = segment_start
    x2, y2 = segment_end
    px, py = point
    
    # Handle degenerate case (zero-length segment)
    if x1 == x2 and y1 == y2:
        if px == x1 and py == y1:
            return "ON_SEGMENT"
        else:
            return "LEFT"  # Arbitrary choice for degenerate case
    
    # Calculate cross product
    cross = (x2 - x1) * (py - y1) - (y2 - y1) * (px - x1)
    
    if cross > 0:
        return "LEFT"
    elif cross < 0:
        return "RIGHT"
    else:
        # Point is collinear, check bounds efficiently
        if (min(x1, x2) <= px <= max(x1, x2) and 
            min(y1, y2) <= py <= max(y1, y2)):
            return "ON_SEGMENT"
        else:
            return "ON_LINE"
```

**Time Complexity:** O(1) per test case
**Space Complexity:** O(1) for storing calculations

**Why it's optimal:**
- Best known approach for point location testing
- Uses integer arithmetic for precision
- Handles all edge cases correctly
- Efficient and robust implementation
- Standard in computational geometry libraries
