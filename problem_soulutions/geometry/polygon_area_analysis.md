# Polygon Area Analysis

## Problem Statement
Calculate the area of a polygon given its vertices in order.

## Solution Progression

### Step 1: Brute Force Approach
**Description**: Divide polygon into triangles and sum their areas.

**Why this is inefficient**:
- Time complexity: O(n³) for triangulation
- Space complexity: O(n)
- Complex triangulation algorithm needed

**Why this improvement works**: We need a simpler approach.

### Step 2: Shoelace Formula
**Description**: Use the shoelace formula to calculate area directly from vertices.

**Why this is inefficient**:
- Time complexity: O(n)
- Space complexity: O(1)
- This is actually optimal

**Why this improvement works**: This is the optimal solution.

## Optimal Solution

### Algorithm: Shoelace Formula
```python
def polygon_area(vertices):
    n = len(vertices)
    area = 0
    
    for i in range(n):
        j = (i + 1) % n
        area += vertices[i][0] * vertices[j][1]
        area -= vertices[j][0] * vertices[i][1]
    
    return abs(area) / 2
```

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) - single pass through vertices
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) - constant extra space

## Key Insights

### Principles
1. **Shoelace Formula**: Area = |Σ(xi * yi+1 - xi+1 * yi)| / 2
2. **Vertex Order**: Vertices must be in clockwise or counterclockwise order
3. **Winding Number**: Formula works for both simple and complex polygons

### Applicability
- **Polygon Operations**: Area calculation for any polygon
- **Geometric Algorithms**: Foundation for many geometric problems
- **Computational Geometry**: Basic building block

## Complete Implementation

```python
def polygon_area(vertices):
    """Calculate area of polygon using shoelace formula"""
    n = len(vertices)
    if n < 3:
        return 0
    
    area = 0
    for i in range(n):
        j = (i + 1) % n
        area += vertices[i][0] * vertices[j][1]
        area -= vertices[j][0] * vertices[i][1]
    
    return abs(area) / 2

# Example usage
vertices = [(0, 0), (4, 0), (4, 3), (0, 3)]
area = polygon_area(vertices)
print(f"Polygon area: {area}")
```

## Edge Cases
1. **Less than 3 vertices**: Return 0
2. **Collinear points**: Handle properly
3. **Self-intersecting polygons**: Formula still works
4. **Clockwise vs counterclockwise**: Order matters for sign
