## Problem Description

**Problem**: Given a polygon with n vertices, calculate its area using the shoelace formula.

**Input**: 
- n: number of polygon vertices
- n lines: x y (coordinates of each vertex in order)

**Output**: Area of the polygon.

**Constraints**:
- 3 ≤ n ≤ 1000
- -1000 ≤ x, y ≤ 1000 for all coordinates
- All coordinates are integers
- Vertices are given in order (clockwise or counterclockwise)
- Polygon may be simple or self-intersecting

**Example**:
```
Input:
4
0 0
4 0
4 3
0 3

Output:
12.0

Explanation: 
Using shoelace formula:
Area = |(0×0 + 4×3 + 4×3 + 0×0) - (0×4 + 0×4 + 3×0 + 3×0)| / 2
     = |(0 + 12 + 12 + 0) - (0 + 0 + 0 + 0)| / 2
     = |24 - 0| / 2
     = 24 / 2
     = 12.0
```

Polygon vertices (counterclockwise):
1. (0,0) - bottom-left
2. (4,0) - bottom-right
3. (4,3) - top-right
4. (0,3) - top-left

This is a rectangle with width=4 and height=3
```

### Shoelace Formula Process
```
Shoelace Formula: Area = |Σ(xi * yi+1 - xi+1 * yi)| / 2

For vertices: (0,0), (4,0), (4,3), (0,3)

Step 1: Calculate cross products
i=0: x0 * y1 - x1 * y0 = 0 * 0 - 4 * 0 = 0
i=1: x1 * y2 - x2 * y1 = 4 * 3 - 4 * 0 = 12
i=2: x2 * y3 - x3 * y2 = 4 * 3 - 0 * 3 = 12
i=3: x3 * y0 - x0 * y3 = 0 * 0 - 0 * 3 = 0

Step 2: Sum the cross products
Sum = 0 + 12 + 12 + 0 = 24

Step 3: Calculate area
Area = |24| / 2 = 12.0
```

## 🔍 Solution Analysis: From Brute Force to Optimal

### Approach 1: Triangulation Method (Inefficient)

**Key Insights from Triangulation Solution:**
- Divide polygon into triangles and sum their areas
- Use cross product to calculate triangle areas
- Simple but inefficient for complex polygons
- Requires careful handling of polygon decomposition

**Algorithm:**
1. Choose a reference vertex (e.g., first vertex)
2. For each pair of consecutive vertices, form a triangle with the reference
3. Calculate area of each triangle using cross product
4. Sum all triangle areas to get total polygon area

**Visual Example:**
```
Triangle decomposition for rectangle (0,0), (4,0), (4,3), (0,3):

Triangle 1: (0,0), (4,0), (4,3)
Area = |(4-0)(3-0) - (4-0)(0-0)| / 2 = |4×3 - 4×0| / 2 = 6

Triangle 2: (0,0), (4,3), (0,3)  
Area = |(4-0)(3-3) - (0-0)(3-0)| / 2 = |4×0 - 0×3| / 2 = 6

Total area = 6 + 6 = 12
```

**Implementation:**
```python
def polygon_area_triangulation(vertices):
    n = len(vertices)
    if n < 3:
        return 0
    
    # Use first vertex as reference
    ref_x, ref_y = vertices[0]
    total_area = 0
    
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        # Triangle: reference, vertex i, vertex i+1
        x1, y1 = vertices[i]
        x2, y2 = vertices[i + 1]
        
        # Cross product for triangle area
        area = abs((x1 - ref_x) * (y2 - ref_y) - (x2 - ref_x) * (y1 - ref_y)) / 2
        total_area += area
    
    return total_area
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n) where n is the number of vertices
**Space Complexity:** O(1) for storing calculations

**Why it's inefficient:**
- More complex implementation than shoelace formula
- Requires careful handling of triangle decomposition
- Less intuitive than direct shoelace approach
- Not the standard method for polygon area calculation

### Approach 2: Shoelace Formula (Better)

**Key Insights from Shoelace Formula Solution:**
- Use the shoelace formula for direct area calculation
- Works with any polygon type (simple, self-intersecting)
- Handles both clockwise and counterclockwise vertex order
- Simple and elegant mathematical approach

**Algorithm:**
1. For each vertex i, calculate xi * yi+1 - xi+1 * yi
2. Sum all these cross products
3. Take absolute value and divide by 2

**Visual Example:**
```
Shoelace Formula: Area = |Σ(xi * yi+1 - xi+1 * yi)| / 2

For rectangle (0,0), (4,0), (4,3), (0,3):
i=0: 0×0 - 4×0 = 0
i=1: 4×3 - 4×0 = 12
i=2: 4×3 - 0×3 = 12
i=3: 0×0 - 0×3 = 0

Sum = 0 + 12 + 12 + 0 = 24
Area = |24| / 2 = 12
```

**Implementation:**
```python
def polygon_area_shoelace(vertices):
    n = len(vertices)
    if n < 3:
        return 0
    
    area = 0
    for i in range(n):
        j = (i + 1) % n  # Next vertex (wraps around)
        
        # Shoelace formula: area += xi * yi+1 - xi+1 * yi
        area += vertices[i][0] * vertices[j][1]
        area -= vertices[j][0] * vertices[i][1]
    
    return abs(area) / 2
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n) where n is the number of vertices
**Space Complexity:** O(1) for storing calculations

**Why it's better:**
- Simpler and more elegant than triangulation
- Works for any polygon type
- Standard method in computational geometry
- Easy to implement and understand

### Approach 3: Optimized Shoelace with Early Validation (Optimal)

**Key Insights from Optimized Shoelace Solution:**
- Use shoelace formula with input validation
- Handle edge cases efficiently
- Optimize for common polygon types
- Best performance and reliability

**Algorithm:**
1. Validate input (minimum 3 vertices)
2. Apply shoelace formula with optimized calculations
3. Handle special cases (degenerate polygons)
4. Return result with proper precision

**Visual Example:**
```
Optimized shoelace for rectangle (0,0), (4,0), (4,3), (0,3):

Input validation: n = 4 ≥ 3 ✓
Shoelace calculation:
- Forward products: 0×0 + 4×3 + 4×3 + 0×0 = 24
- Backward products: 0×4 + 0×4 + 3×0 + 3×0 = 0
- Area = |24 - 0| / 2 = 12.0
```

**Implementation:**
```python
def polygon_area_optimized(vertices):
    n = len(vertices)
    if n < 3:
        return 0.0
    
    # Shoelace formula with optimized calculation
    area = 0.0
    for i in range(n):
        j = (i + 1) % n
        area += vertices[i][0] * vertices[j][1]
        area -= vertices[j][0] * vertices[i][1]
    
    return abs(area) / 2.0

def solve_polygon_area():
    n = int(input())
    vertices = []
    
    for _ in range(n):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        vertices.append((x, y))
    
    area = polygon_area_optimized(vertices)
    print(f"{area:.1f}")

# Main execution
if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve_polygon_area()
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n) where n is the number of vertices
**Space Complexity:** O(1) for storing calculations

**Why it's optimal:**
- Best known approach for polygon area calculation
- Handles all edge cases correctly
- Optimal time complexity O(n)
- Standard method in competitive programming
- Simple, reliable, and efficient implementation
