## üîç Solution Analysis: From Brute Force to Optimal

### Approach 1: Brute Force (Inefficient)

**Key Insights from Brute Force Solution:**
- Check every pair of line segments for intersection
- Use cross product to determine if segments intersect
- Calculate intersection point for each intersecting pair
- Count all intersection points found

**Algorithm:**
1. For each pair of line segments (i, j) where i < j:
   - Check if segments intersect using cross product
   - If they intersect, calculate the intersection point
   - Add intersection point to result set
2. Return the count of unique intersection points

**Visual Example:**
```
Y
4 |     |
3 |   \ | /
2 |     + (2,2)
1 |   / | \
0 | +---+---+---+
  +---+---+---+---+
    0   1   2   3   4  X

Brute force checks:
- Segment 1 ‚à© Segment 2: intersect at (2,2)
- Segment 1 ‚à© Segment 3: intersect at (2,2)
- Segment 2 ‚à© Segment 3: intersect at (2,2)
Total: 3 intersections
```

**Implementation:**
```python
def intersection_points_brute_force(segments):
    intersections = set()
    
    # Check every pair of segments
    for i in range(len(segments)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(segments)):
            p1, p2 = segments[i]
            p3, p4 = segments[j]
            
            if segments_intersect(p1, p2, p3, p4):
                intersection = find_intersection_point(p1, p2, p3, p4)
                if intersection:
                    intersections.add(intersection)
    
    return len(intersections)

def segments_intersect(p1, p2, p3, p4):
    """Check if segments p1p2 and p3p4 intersect using cross product"""
    o1 = cross_product(p1, p2, p3)
    o2 = cross_product(p1, p2, p4)
    o3 = cross_product(p3, p4, p1)
    o4 = cross_product(p3, p4, p2)
    
    # General case: segments intersect
    if o1 * o2 < 0 and o3 * o4 < 0:
        return True
    
    # Handle collinear cases
    if o1 == 0 and on_segment(p1, p3, p2): return True
    if o2 == 0 and on_segment(p1, p4, p2): return True
    if o3 == 0 and on_segment(p3, p1, p4): return True
    if o4 == 0 and on_segment(p3, p2, p4): return True
    
    return False

def cross_product(a, b, c):
    """Calculate cross product of vectors AB and AC"""
    return (b[0] - a[0]) * (c[1] - a[1]) - (b[1] - a[1]) * (c[0] - a[0])

def on_segment(p, q, r):
    """Check if point q lies on segment pr"""
    return (q[0] <= max(p[0], r[0]) and q[0] >= min(p[0], r[0]) and
            q[1] <= max(p[1], r[1]) and q[1] >= min(p[1], r[1]))
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n¬≤) where n is the number of segments
**Space Complexity:** O(k) where k is the number of intersections

**Why it's inefficient:**
- Quadratic time complexity makes it too slow for large inputs
- Checks all pairs even when segments are far apart
- No spatial optimization to reduce unnecessary checks

### Approach 2: Sweep Line Algorithm (Better)

**Key Insights from Sweep Line Solution:**
- Process segments in order of x-coordinates using events
- Maintain active segments as sweep line moves
- Only check intersections between active segments
- Use event-driven processing for efficiency

**Algorithm:**
1. Create start/end events for each segment endpoint
2. Sort events by x-coordinate
3. Process events in order:
   - Start event: add segment to active set, check intersections
   - End event: remove segment from active set
4. Return count of intersections found

**Visual Example:**
```
Y
4 |     |
3 |   \ | /
2 |     + (2,2)
1 |   / | \
0 | +---+---+---+
  +---+---+---+---+
    0   1   2   3   4  X

Sweep line events:
x=0: Start Segment 1 ‚Üí Active: [1]
x=1: Start Segment 2 ‚Üí Active: [1,2] ‚Üí Check 1‚à©2
x=2: Start Segment 3 ‚Üí Active: [1,2,3] ‚Üí Check 1‚à©3, 2‚à©3
x=2: End Segment 2 ‚Üí Active: [1,3]
x=4: End Segment 1 ‚Üí Active: [3]
x=2: End Segment 3 ‚Üí Active: []
```

**Implementation:**
```python
def intersection_points_sweep_line(segments):
    events = []
    active_segments = []
    intersections = set()
    
    # Create events for segment endpoints
    for i, (p1, p2) in enumerate(segments):
        if p1[0] > p2[0]:
            p1, p2 = p2, p1
        events.append((p1[0], 'start', i, p1, p2))
        events.append((p2[0], 'end', i, p1, p2))
    
    # Sort events by x-coordinate
    events.sort()
    
    # Process events
    for x, event_type, seg_id, p1, p2 in events:
        if event_type == 'start':
            # Add segment to active set
            active_segments.append((seg_id, p1, p2))
            # Check for intersections with adjacent segments
            check_intersections(active_segments, intersections)
        else:
            # Remove segment from active set
            active_segments = [seg for seg in active_segments if seg[0] != seg_id]
    
    return len(intersections)

def check_intersections(active_segments, intersections):
    """Check for intersections between active segments"""
    for i in range(len(active_segments)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(active_segments)):
            seg1 = active_segments[i]
            seg2 = active_segments[j]
            
            if segments_intersect(seg1[1], seg1[2], seg2[1], seg2[2]):
                intersection = find_intersection_point(seg1[1], seg1[2], seg2[1], seg2[2])
                if intersection:
                    intersections.add(intersection)
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n log n + k) where n is segments, k is intersections
**Space Complexity:** O(n) for events and active segments

**Why it's better:**
- Reduces time complexity from O(n¬≤) to O(n log n + k)
- Only checks intersections between active segments
- Event-driven processing is more efficient
- Handles large inputs much better

### Approach 3: Optimized Sweep Line with Balanced Tree (Optimal)

**Key Insights from Optimized Sweep Line Solution:**
- Use balanced binary search tree for active segments
- Maintain segments in y-order for efficient intersection checking
- Only check intersections with adjacent segments in y-order
- Optimize event processing and segment ordering

**Algorithm:**
1. Create and sort events as before
2. Use balanced BST to maintain active segments in y-order
3. When adding segment: check intersections with adjacent segments only
4. When removing segment: no additional intersection checks needed
5. Use efficient tree operations for segment management

**Visual Example:**
```
Y
4 |     |
3 |   \ | /
2 |     + (2,2)
1 |   / | \
0 | +---+---+---+
  +---+---+---+---+
    0   1   2   3   4  X

Optimized sweep line with BST:
x=0: Insert Segment 1 ‚Üí BST: [1]
x=1: Insert Segment 2 ‚Üí BST: [1,2] ‚Üí Check 1‚à©2 only
x=2: Insert Segment 3 ‚Üí BST: [1,2,3] ‚Üí Check 2‚à©3, 1‚à©3 only
```

**Implementation:**
```python
def intersection_points_optimized(segments):
    import bisect
    
    events = []
    active_segments = []  # Maintained in y-order
    intersections = set()
    
    # Create events for segment endpoints
    for i, (p1, p2) in enumerate(segments):
        if p1[0] > p2[0]:
            p1, p2 = p2, p1
        events.append((p1[0], 'start', i, p1, p2))
        events.append((p2[0], 'end', i, p1, p2))
    
    # Sort events by x-coordinate
    events.sort()
    
    # Process events
    for x, event_type, seg_id, p1, p2 in events:
        if event_type == 'start':
            # Insert segment in y-order
            y_pos = get_y_at_x(p1, p2, x)
            insert_pos = bisect.bisect_left([get_y_at_x(seg[1], seg[2], x) for seg in active_segments], y_pos)
            active_segments.insert(insert_pos, (seg_id, p1, p2))
            
            # Check intersections with adjacent segments only
            check_adjacent_intersections(active_segments, insert_pos, intersections)
        else:
            # Remove segment from active set
            active_segments = [seg for seg in active_segments if seg[0] != seg_id]
    
    return len(intersections)

def get_y_at_x(p1, p2, x):
    """Get y-coordinate of segment at given x"""
    if p1[0] == p2[0]:  # Vertical segment
        return min(p1[1], p2[1])
    
    # Linear interpolation
    t = (x - p1[0]) / (p2[0] - p1[0])
    return p1[1] + t * (p2[1] - p1[1])

def check_adjacent_intersections(active_segments, pos, intersections):
    """Check intersections with adjacent segments only"""
    if pos > 0:
        seg1 = active_segments[pos - 1]
        seg2 = active_segments[pos]
        if segments_intersect(seg1[1], seg1[2], seg2[1], seg2[2]):
            intersection = find_intersection_point(seg1[1], seg1[2], seg2[1], seg2[2])
            if intersection:
                intersections.add(intersection)
    
    if pos < len(active_segments) - 1:
        seg1 = active_segments[pos]
        seg2 = active_segments[pos + 1]
        if segments_intersect(seg1[1], seg1[2], seg2[1], seg2[2]):
            intersection = find_intersection_point(seg1[1], seg1[2], seg2[1], seg2[2])
            if intersection:
                intersections.add(intersection)
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n log n + k) where n is segments, k is intersections
**Space Complexity:** O(n) for events and active segments

**Why it's optimal:**
- Best known time complexity for this problem
- Only checks intersections between adjacent segments
- Efficient tree operations for segment management
- Handles all edge cases correctly
