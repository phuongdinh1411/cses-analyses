## üîç Solution Analysis: From Brute Force to Optimal

### Approach 1: Recursive Brute Force (Inefficient)

**Key Insights from Recursive Brute Force Solution:**
- Try all possible paths from start to target
- Use recursion to explore all directions
- Check for obstacles and boundaries at each step
- Return minimum path length among all valid paths

**Algorithm:**
1. Start from current position
2. If current position is target, return 0
3. If current position is obstacle or out of bounds, return infinity
4. Recursively try all 4 directions
5. Return 1 + minimum of all valid recursive calls

**Visual Example:**
```
Y
4 | . . . . T
3 | . . . . .
2 | . O . . .
1 | . O . O .
0 | S . . . .
  +---+---+---+---+---+
    0   1   2   3   4  X

Recursive exploration from (0,0):
- Try (0,1): valid, recurse
- Try (1,0): valid, recurse
- Try (0,-1): invalid (out of bounds)
- Try (-1,0): invalid (out of bounds)
```

**Implementation:**
```python
def robot_path_recursive(obstacles, target, current=(0, 0), visited=None):
    if visited is None:
        visited = set()
    
    x, y = current
    
    # Base cases
    if current == target:
        return 0
    
    if current in obstacles or current in visited:
        return float('inf')
    
    if x < 0 or y < 0 or x > 1000 or y > 1000:
        return float('inf')
    
    # Mark current position as visited
    visited.add(current)
    
    # Try all 4 directions
    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]
    min_path = float('inf')
    
    for dx, dy in directions:
        next_pos = (x + dx, y + dy)
        if next_pos not in visited:
            path_length = robot_path_recursive(obstacles, target, next_pos, visited.copy())
            min_path = min(min_path, path_length)
    
    return 1 + min_path if min_path != float('inf') else float('inf')
```

**Time Complexity:** O(4^n) where n is the maximum distance to target
**Space Complexity:** O(n) for recursion stack

**Why it's inefficient:**
- Exponential time complexity due to exploring all possible paths
- Redundant calculations for the same positions
- No memoization to avoid repeated work

### Approach 2: Breadth-First Search (Better)

**Key Insights from BFS Solution:**
- BFS guarantees shortest path in unweighted graphs
- Use queue to explore positions level by level
- Mark visited positions to avoid cycles
- Stop as soon as target is reached

**Algorithm:**
1. Initialize queue with start position and distance 0
2. While queue is not empty:
   - Dequeue current position and distance
   - If current position is target, return distance
   - Mark current position as visited
   - Add all valid neighbors to queue with distance + 1
3. Return -1 if target is unreachable

**Visual Example:**
```
Y
4 | . . . . T
3 | . . . . .
2 | . O . . .
1 | . O . O .
0 | S . . . .
  +---+---+---+---+---+
    0   1   2   3   4  X

BFS Level 0: (0,0) - distance 0
BFS Level 1: (0,1), (1,0) - distance 1
BFS Level 2: (0,2), (1,1), (2,0) - distance 2
BFS Level 3: (0,3), (2,1), (3,0) - distance 3
...
```

**Implementation:**
```python
def robot_path_bfs(obstacles, target):
    from collections import deque
    
    # Convert obstacles to set for O(1) lookup
    obstacle_set = set(obstacles)
    
    # BFS queue: (x, y, distance)
    queue = deque([(0, 0, 0)])
    visited = set()
    
    # 4 directions: up, right, down, left
    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]
    
    while queue:
        x, y, dist = queue.popleft()
        
        if (x, y) == target:
            return dist
        
        if (x, y) in visited:
            continue
            
        visited.add((x, y))
        
        # Try all 4 directions
        for dx, dy in directions:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            
            if (nx, ny) not in obstacle_set and (nx, ny) not in visited:
                queue.append((nx, ny, dist + 1))
    
    return -1  # Target unreachable
```

**Time Complexity:** O(area) where area is the maximum reachable area
**Space Complexity:** O(area) for queue and visited set

**Why it's better:**
- Guarantees shortest path
- Polynomial time complexity
- Efficient obstacle avoidance
- Clear and implementable

### Approach 3: A* Search (Optimal)

**Key Insights from A* Search Solution:**
- Use heuristic function to guide search towards target
- Combine actual distance (g) with estimated distance (h)
- Use priority queue to always expand most promising nodes
- Manhattan distance provides good heuristic for grid problems

**Algorithm:**
1. Initialize priority queue with start position, g=0, f=heuristic
2. While queue is not empty:
   - Pop node with lowest f-score
   - If current position is target, return g-score
   - Mark current position as visited
   - For each neighbor:
     - Calculate new g-score (current g + 1)
     - Calculate h-score (Manhattan distance to target)
     - Calculate f-score (g + h)
     - Add to queue if not visited and not obstacle
3. Return -1 if target is unreachable

**Visual Example:**
```
Y
4 | . . . . T
3 | . . . . .
2 | . O . . .
1 | . O . O .
0 | S . . . .
  +---+---+---+---+---+
    0   1   2   3   4  X

A* Search with Manhattan distance heuristic:
- From (0,0): h = |0-4| + |0-4| = 8, f = 0 + 8 = 8
- From (0,1): h = |0-4| + |1-4| = 7, f = 1 + 7 = 8
- From (1,0): h = |1-4| + |0-4| = 7, f = 1 + 7 = 8
```

**Implementation:**
```python
def robot_path_astar(obstacles, target):
    import heapq
    
    obstacle_set = set(obstacles)
    
    # Priority queue: (f_score, g_score, x, y)
    # f_score = g_score + heuristic
    queue = [(0, 0, 0, 0)]
    visited = set()
    
    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]
    
    while queue:
        f_score, g_score, x, y = heapq.heappop(queue)
        
        if (x, y) == target:
            return g_score
        
        if (x, y) in visited:
            continue
            
        visited.add((x, y))
        
        for dx, dy in directions:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            
            if (nx, ny) not in obstacle_set and (nx, ny) not in visited:
                new_g = g_score + 1
                h = abs(nx - target[0]) + abs(ny - target[1])  # Manhattan distance
                f = new_g + h
                heapq.heappush(queue, (f, new_g, nx, ny))
    
    return -1
```

**Time Complexity:** O(area log area) in worst case, but much better in practice
**Space Complexity:** O(area) for priority queue and visited set

**Why it's optimal:**
- Finds shortest path with fewer node expansions than BFS
- Heuristic guides search towards target
- More efficient for large search spaces
- Industry standard for pathfinding problems

        if (x, y) in visited:
            continue
            
        visited.add((x, y))
        
        for i, (dx, dy) in enumerate(directions):
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            
            if (nx, ny) not in obstacle_set and (nx, ny) not in visited:
                new_cost = cost + costs[i]
                queue.append((nx, ny, new_cost))
    
    return -1
```

### Variation 3: Robot with Multiple Targets
**Problem**: Find shortest path visiting multiple targets in any order.

**Link**: [CSES Problem Set - Robot Path with Multiple Targets](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/robot_path_multiple_targets)

    from itertools import permutations
    
    def path_to_target(start, end):
        return robot_path_bfs(obstacles, end, start)
    
    min_total = float('inf')
    
    # Try all possible orders of visiting targets
    for target_order in permutations(targets):
        current = (0, 0)
        total_dist = 0
        
        for target in target_order:
            dist = path_to_target(current, target)
            if dist == -1:
                break
            total_dist += dist
            current = target
        else:
            min_total = min(min_total, total_dist)
    
    return min_total if min_total != float('inf') else -1
```
