## Problem Description

There are n pupils in Uolevi's class, and m friendships between them. Your task is to divide the pupils into two teams in such a way that no two pupils in a team are friends. You can freely choose the sizes of the teams.

This is a classic bipartite graph coloring problem where we need to check if the friendship graph can be colored with 2 colors such that no adjacent vertices have the same color.

**Input**: 
- First line: Two integers n and m (number of pupils and friendships)
- Next m lines: Two integers a and b (pupils a and b are friends)

**Output**: 
- Print "IMPOSSIBLE" if not possible, otherwise print team assignment

**Constraints**:
- 1 ‚â§ n ‚â§ 10‚Åµ
- 1 ‚â§ m ‚â§ 2‚ãÖ10‚Åµ
- Pupils are numbered 1, 2, ..., n
- Graph is undirected
- No self-loops or multiple edges between same pair of pupils
- Friendships are bidirectional
- Divide pupils into two teams
- No two friends can be on the same team
- Check if bipartite coloring is possible
- Output team assignment or "IMPOSSIBLE"

**Example**:
```
Input:
5 3
1 2
1 3
4 5

Output:
1 2 2 1 1
```

**Explanation**: 
- Pupil 1: Team 1
- Pupil 2: Team 2 (friend of 1)
- Pupil 3: Team 2 (friend of 1)
- Pupil 4: Team 1
- Pupil 5: Team 1 (friend of 4)

## Visual Example

### Input Graph
```
Pupils: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
Friendships: (1,2), (1,3), (4,5)

Graph representation:
1 ‚îÄ‚îÄ 2
‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 3

4 ‚îÄ‚îÄ 5
```

### Bipartite Coloring Process
```
Step 1: Initialize colors
- color[1] = color[2] = color[3] = color[4] = color[5] = -1 (uncolored)

Step 2: BFS coloring
- Start from pupil 1: color[1] = 1 (Team 1)
- Queue: [1]

- Process pupil 1:
  - Neighbors: 2, 3
  - color[2] = 2 (Team 2)
  - color[3] = 2 (Team 2)
  - Queue: [2, 3]

- Process pupil 2:
  - Neighbors: 1 (already colored)
  - No new assignments

- Process pupil 3:
  - Neighbors: 1 (already colored)
  - No new assignments

- Process pupil 4:
  - color[4] = 1 (Team 1)
  - Neighbors: 5
  - color[5] = 2 (Team 2)
  - Queue: [5]

- Process pupil 5:
  - Neighbors: 4 (already colored)
  - No new assignments
```

### Team Assignment
```
Final team assignments:
- Pupil 1: Team 1
- Pupil 2: Team 2
- Pupil 3: Team 2
- Pupil 4: Team 1
- Pupil 5: Team 2

Verification:
- (1,2): Team 1 ‚â† Team 2 ‚úì
- (1,3): Team 1 ‚â† Team 2 ‚úì
- (4,5): Team 1 ‚â† Team 2 ‚úì

All friendships satisfied ‚úì
```

### Key Insight
Bipartite coloring algorithm works by:
1. Using BFS to traverse the graph
2. Assigning alternating colors to adjacent vertices
3. Checking for color conflicts (odd-length cycles)
4. Time complexity: O(n + m) for graph traversal
5. Space complexity: O(n + m) for graph representation

## üîç Solution Analysis: From Brute Force to Optimal

### Approach 1: Brute Force Team Assignment (Inefficient)

**Key Insights from Brute Force Solution:**
- Try all possible team assignments and check for conflicts
- Simple but computationally expensive approach
- Not suitable for large graphs
- Straightforward implementation but poor performance

**Algorithm:**
1. Generate all possible team assignments (2^n possibilities)
2. For each assignment, check if any friends are on the same team
3. Return the first valid assignment found
4. Handle cases where no valid assignment exists

**Visual Example:**
```
Brute force: Try all possible team assignments
For graph: 1 ‚îÄ‚îÄ 2
           ‚îÇ
           ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 3

All possible team assignments:
- Assignment 1: [1,1,1,1,1] - Check conflicts: (1,2) same team ‚úó
- Assignment 2: [1,1,1,1,2] - Check conflicts: (1,2) same team ‚úó
- Assignment 3: [1,1,1,2,1] - Check conflicts: (1,2) same team ‚úó
- Assignment 4: [1,1,1,2,2] - Check conflicts: (1,2) same team ‚úó
- Assignment 5: [1,1,2,1,1] - Check conflicts: (1,2) same team ‚úó
- Assignment 6: [1,1,2,1,2] - Check conflicts: (1,2) same team ‚úó
- Assignment 7: [1,1,2,2,1] - Check conflicts: (1,2) same team ‚úó
- Assignment 8: [1,1,2,2,2] - Check conflicts: (1,2) same team ‚úó
- Assignment 9: [1,2,1,1,1] - Check conflicts: (1,2) different teams ‚úì, (1,3) different teams ‚úì

First valid assignment: [1,2,2,1,1]
```

**Implementation:**
```python
def building_teams_brute_force(n, m, friendships):
    def is_valid_assignment(assignment):
        for a, b in friendships:
            if assignment[a-1] == assignment[b-1]:
                return False
        return True
    
    def generate_assignments(n):
        if n == 0:
            return [[]]
        
        smaller = generate_assignments(n-1)
        result = []
        for assignment in smaller:
            result.append(assignment + [1])
            result.append(assignment + [2])
        return result
    
    # Generate all possible team assignments
    all_assignments = generate_assignments(n)
    
    # Check each assignment
    for assignment in all_assignments:
        if is_valid_assignment(assignment):
            return ' '.join(map(str, assignment))
    
    return "IMPOSSIBLE"
```

**Time Complexity:** O(2^n √ó m) for n pupils and m friendships with exponential assignment generation
**Space Complexity:** O(2^n) for storing all possible assignments

**Why it's inefficient:**
- O(2^n √ó m) time complexity is too slow for large graphs
- Not suitable for competitive programming
- Inefficient for large inputs
- Poor performance with many pupils

### Approach 2: Basic BFS with Bipartite Coloring (Better)

**Key Insights from Basic BFS Solution:**
- Use BFS to check if graph is bipartite
- Much more efficient than brute force approach
- Standard method for bipartite graph problems
- Can handle larger graphs than brute force

**Algorithm:**
1. Use BFS to traverse the graph
2. Assign alternating colors to adjacent vertices
3. Check for color conflicts during traversal
4. Return team assignment if bipartite

**Visual Example:**
```
Basic BFS for graph: 1 ‚îÄ‚îÄ 2
                     ‚îÇ
                     ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 3

Step 1: Initialize
- color = [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1]
- Queue = [1]

Step 2: Process vertex 1
- color[1] = 1 (Team 1)
- Neighbors: 2, 3
- color[2] = 2 (Team 2)
- color[3] = 2 (Team 2)
- Queue = [2, 3]

Step 3: Process vertices 2 and 3
- No new color assignments needed
- Queue = []

Step 4: Process remaining vertices
- color[4] = 1 (Team 1)
- color[5] = 2 (Team 2)

Final: color = [1, 2, 2, 1, 1]
```

**Implementation:**
```python
from collections import deque

def building_teams_basic_bfs(n, m, friendships):
    # Build adjacency list
    graph = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for a, b in friendships:
        graph[a].append(b)
        graph[b].append(a)
    
    def is_bipartite():
        color = [-1] * (n + 1)  # -1: uncolored, 0: team 1, 1: team 2
        
        for start in range(1, n + 1):
            if color[start] == -1:
                queue = deque([start])
                color[start] = 0
                
                while queue:
                    node = queue.popleft()
                    
                    for neighbor in graph[node]:
                        if color[neighbor] == -1:
                            color[neighbor] = 1 - color[node]  # Opposite color
                            queue.append(neighbor)
                        elif color[neighbor] == color[node]:
                            return False  # Not bipartite
        
        return True, color
    
    result = is_bipartite()
    if not result[0]:
        return "IMPOSSIBLE"
    else:
        color = result[1]
        return ' '.join(str(color[i] + 1) for i in range(1, n + 1))
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n + m) for n pupils and m friendships with BFS
**Space Complexity:** O(n + m) for adjacency list and color array

**Why it's better:**
- O(n + m) time complexity is much better than O(2^n √ó m)
- Standard method for bipartite graph problems
- Suitable for competitive programming
- Efficient for most practical cases

### Approach 3: Optimized BFS with Efficient Color Management (Optimal)

**Key Insights from Optimized BFS Solution:**
- Use optimized BFS with efficient color management
- Most efficient approach for bipartite graph coloring
- Standard method in competitive programming
- Can handle the maximum constraint efficiently

**Algorithm:**
1. Use optimized BFS with efficient data structures
2. Implement efficient color conflict detection
3. Use proper color assignment and conflict checking
4. Return team assignment if bipartite

**Visual Example:**
```
Optimized BFS for graph: 1 ‚îÄ‚îÄ 2
                         ‚îÇ
                         ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 3

Step 1: Initialize optimized structures
- graph = [[], [2,3], [1], [1], [5], [4]]
- color = [-1] * 6
- Queue = deque()

Step 2: Process with optimized BFS
- Start from vertex 1: color[1] = 0, Queue = [1]
- Process vertex 1: color[2] = 1, color[3] = 1, Queue = [2, 3]
- Process vertex 2: no new assignments, Queue = [3]
- Process vertex 3: no new assignments, Queue = []

Step 3: Process remaining components
- Start from vertex 4: color[4] = 0, color[5] = 1

Final: color = [0, 1, 1, 0, 1] ‚Üí teams = [1, 2, 2, 1, 2]
```

**Implementation:**
```python
from collections import deque

def building_teams_optimized_bfs(n, m, friendships):
    # Build adjacency list
    graph = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for a, b in friendships:
        graph[a].append(b)
        graph[b].append(a)
    
    def is_bipartite():
        color = [-1] * (n + 1)  # -1: uncolored, 0: team 1, 1: team 2
        
        for start in range(1, n + 1):
            if color[start] == -1:
                queue = deque([start])
                color[start] = 0
                
                while queue:
                    node = queue.popleft()
                    
                    for neighbor in graph[node]:
                        if color[neighbor] == -1:
                            color[neighbor] = 1 - color[node]  # Opposite color
                            queue.append(neighbor)
                        elif color[neighbor] == color[node]:
                            return False  # Not bipartite
        
        return True, color
    
    result = is_bipartite()
    if not result[0]:
        return "IMPOSSIBLE"
    else:
        color = result[1]
        return ' '.join(str(color[i] + 1) for i in range(1, n + 1))

def solve_building_teams():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    friendships = []
    for _ in range(m):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        friendships.append((a, b))
    
    result = building_teams_optimized_bfs(n, m, friendships)
    print(result)

# Main execution
if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve_building_teams()
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n + m) for n pupils and m friendships with optimized BFS
**Space Complexity:** O(n + m) for adjacency list and color array

**Why it's optimal:**
- O(n + m) time complexity is optimal for bipartite graph coloring
- Uses optimized BFS with efficient color management
- Most efficient approach for competitive programming
- Standard method for bipartite graph coloring problems
