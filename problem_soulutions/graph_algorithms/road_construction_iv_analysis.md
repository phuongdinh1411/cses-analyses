## Problem Description

**Problem**: Given a graph with n cities and m roads, find the minimum cost to build roads so that all cities are connected. Each road has a construction cost.

**Input**: 
- First line: Two integers n and m (number of cities and roads)
- Next m lines: Three integers a, b, and c (road between cities a and b with cost c)

**Output**: 
- Minimum cost to build roads so all cities are connected, or "IMPOSSIBLE" if not possible

**Constraints**:
- 1 ‚â§ n ‚â§ 10‚Åµ
- 1 ‚â§ m ‚â§ 2‚ãÖ10‚Åµ
- 1 ‚â§ a, b ‚â§ n
- 1 ‚â§ c ‚â§ 10‚Åπ
- All roads are bidirectional
- Cities are numbered from 1 to n

**Example**:
```
Input:
4 4
1 2 1
2 3 2
3 4 3
1 4 4

Output:
6
```

**Explanation**: 
- Roads: (1,2) cost 1, (2,3) cost 2, (3,4) cost 3, (1,4) cost 4
- Minimum spanning tree: (1,2) + (2,3) + (3,4) = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6
- This connects all cities with minimum cost

## Visual Example

### Input Graph
```
Cities: 1, 2, 3, 4
Roads: (1,2,1), (2,3,2), (3,4,3), (1,4,4)

Graph representation:
1 ‚îÄ‚îÄ1‚îÄ‚îÄ 2 ‚îÄ‚îÄ2‚îÄ‚îÄ 3 ‚îÄ‚îÄ3‚îÄ‚îÄ 4
‚îÇ                    ‚îÇ

```

### Kruskal's Algorithm Process
```
Step 1: Sort edges by weight
Edges: [(1,2,1), (2,3,2), (3,4,3), (1,4,4)]

Step 2: Initialize Union-Find
Parent: [1, 2, 3, 4] (each city is its own parent)
Rank: [0, 0, 0, 0]

Step 3: Process edges in order

Edge (1,2,1):
- Find(1) = 1, Find(2) = 2
- Different components, add edge
- Union(1,2): Parent[2] = 1, Rank[1] = 1
- MST edges: [(1,2,1)]
- Total cost: 1

Edge (2,3,2):
- Find(2) = 1, Find(3) = 3
- Different components, add edge
- Union(1,3): Parent[3] = 1, Rank[1] = 1
- MST edges: [(1,2,1), (2,3,2)]
- Total cost: 1 + 2 = 3

Edge (3,4,3):
- Find(3) = 1, Find(4) = 4
- Different components, add edge
- Union(1,4): Parent[4] = 1, Rank[1] = 2
- MST edges: [(1,2,1), (2,3,2), (3,4,3)]
- Total cost: 1 + 2 + 3 = 6

Edge (1,4,4):
- Find(1) = 1, Find(4) = 1
- Same component, skip edge
- MST edges: [(1,2,1), (2,3,2), (3,4,3)]
- Total cost: 6
```

### Final MST

Minimum Spanning Tree:
1 ‚îÄ‚îÄ1‚îÄ‚îÄ 2 ‚îÄ‚îÄ2‚îÄ‚îÄ 3 ‚îÄ‚îÄ3‚îÄ‚îÄ 4

Total cost: 6
All cities are connected with minimum cost.
```

## üîç Solution Analysis: From Brute Force to Optimal

### Approach 1: Brute Force MST (Inefficient)

**Key Insights from Brute Force Solution:**
- Check all possible combinations of edges to find minimum spanning tree
- Use exhaustive search to find the optimal solution
- Simple but computationally expensive approach
- Not suitable for large graphs

**Algorithm:**
1. Generate all possible combinations of n-1 edges
2. Check if each combination forms a spanning tree
3. Calculate total cost for valid spanning trees
4. Return minimum cost found

**Visual Example:**
```
Brute force: Check all combinations
For cities: 1, 2, 3, 4 with roads (1,2,1), (2,3,2), (3,4,3), (1,4,4)

All possible combinations of 3 edges:
- (1,2,1), (2,3,2), (3,4,3) ‚Üí cost = 6 ‚úì (spanning tree)
- (1,2,1), (2,3,2), (1,4,4) ‚Üí cost = 7 ‚úì (spanning tree)
- (1,2,1), (3,4,3), (1,4,4) ‚Üí cost = 8 ‚úì (spanning tree)
- (2,3,2), (3,4,3), (1,4,4) ‚Üí cost = 9 ‚úì (spanning tree)

Minimum cost: 6
```

**Implementation:**
```python
def road_construction_brute_force(n, m, roads):
    from itertools import combinations
    
    min_cost = float('inf')
    
    # Try all combinations of n-1 edges
    for edge_combination in combinations(roads, n - 1):
        # Check if this combination forms a spanning tree
        if is_spanning_tree(edge_combination, n):
            total_cost = sum(edge[2] for edge in edge_combination)
            min_cost = min(min_cost, total_cost)
    
    return min_cost if min_cost != float('inf') else "IMPOSSIBLE"

def is_spanning_tree(edges, n):
    # Build graph from edges
    graph = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for a, b, cost in edges:
        graph[a].append(b)
        graph[b].append(a)
    
    # Check connectivity using DFS
    visited = [False] * (n + 1)
    
    def dfs(node):
        visited[node] = True
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            if not visited[neighbor]:
                dfs(neighbor)
    
    dfs(1)
    return all(visited[i] for i in range(1, n + 1))
```

**Time Complexity:** O(C(m, n-1) √ó (n + m)) where C(m, n-1) is the number of combinations
**Space Complexity:** O(n + m) for graph representation

**Why it's inefficient:**
- Exponential time complexity due to checking all combinations
- Not suitable for large graphs
- Overkill for this specific problem
- Not practical for competitive programming

### Approach 2: Kruskal's Algorithm (Better)

**Key Insights from Kruskal's Solution:**
- Use greedy approach by sorting edges by weight
- Use Union-Find data structure to detect cycles
- Add edges that connect different components
- Much more efficient than brute force approach

**Algorithm:**
1. Sort all edges by weight in ascending order
2. Initialize Union-Find data structure
3. Process edges in order, adding edges that don't create cycles
4. Stop when we have n-1 edges (spanning tree complete)

**Visual Example:**
```
Kruskal's algorithm for cities: 1, 2, 3, 4 with roads (1,2,1), (2,3,2), (3,4,3), (1,4,4)

Step 1: Sort edges by weight
Edges: [(1,2,1), (2,3,2), (3,4,3), (1,4,4)]

Step 2: Process edges in order
- Add (1,2,1): cost = 1, connects 1-2
- Add (2,3,2): cost = 2, connects 1-2-3
- Add (3,4,3): cost = 3, connects 1-2-3-4
- Skip (1,4,4): would create cycle

Total cost: 1 + 2 + 3 = 6
```

**Implementation:**
```python
def road_construction_kruskal(n, m, roads):
    # Sort roads by cost
    roads.sort(key=lambda x: x[2])
    
    # Union-Find for cycle detection
    parent = list(range(n + 1))
    rank = [0] * (n + 1)
    
    def find(x):
        if parent[x] != x:
            parent[x] = find(parent[x])
        return parent[x]
    
    def union(x, y):
        px, py = find(x), find(y)
        if px == py:
            return False
        
        if rank[px] < rank[py]:
            parent[px] = py
        elif rank[px] > rank[py]:
            parent[py] = px
        else:
            parent[py] = px
            rank[px] += 1
        return True
    
    # Kruskal's algorithm
    total_cost = 0
    edges_used = 0
    
    for a, b, cost in roads:
        if union(a, b):
            total_cost += cost
            edges_used += 1
    
    # Check if all cities are connected
    if edges_used == n - 1:
        return total_cost
    else:
        return "IMPOSSIBLE"
```

**Time Complexity:** O(m log m) for sorting + O(m Œ±(n)) for Union-Find operations
**Space Complexity:** O(n) for Union-Find data structure

**Why it's better:**
- Much more efficient than brute force
- O(m log m) time complexity is optimal for MST
- Simple and intuitive greedy approach
- Standard method for MST problems

### Approach 3: Optimized Kruskal's Algorithm (Optimal)

**Key Insights from Optimized Kruskal's Solution:**
- Use optimized Union-Find with path compression and union by rank
- Handle edge cases efficiently
- Best performance and reliability
- Standard method for minimum spanning tree

**Algorithm:**
1. Sort edges by weight using efficient sorting
2. Initialize optimized Union-Find with path compression
3. Process edges in order with cycle detection
4. Return minimum cost or "IMPOSSIBLE"

**Visual Example:**
```
Optimized Kruskal's for cities: 1, 2, 3, 4 with roads (1,2,1), (2,3,2), (3,4,3), (1,4,4)

Optimized Union-Find operations:
Initial: Parent = [1, 2, 3, 4], Rank = [0, 0, 0, 0]

Process (1,2,1):
- Union(1,2): Parent = [1, 1, 3, 4], Rank = [1, 0, 0, 0]
- Cost: 1

Process (2,3,2):
- Union(1,3): Parent = [1, 1, 1, 4], Rank = [1, 0, 0, 0]
- Cost: 1 + 2 = 3

Process (3,4,3):
- Union(1,4): Parent = [1, 1, 1, 1], Rank = [1, 0, 0, 0]
- Cost: 1 + 2 + 3 = 6

Process (1,4,4):
- Find(1) = 1, Find(4) = 1 (same component, skip)
- Final cost: 6
```

**Implementation:**
```python
class UnionFind:
    def __init__(self, n):
        self.parent = list(range(n + 1))
        self.rank = [0] * (n + 1)
    
    def find(self, x):
        if self.parent[x] != x:
            self.parent[x] = self.find(self.parent[x])
        return self.parent[x]
    
    def union(self, x, y):
        px, py = self.find(x), self.find(y)
        if px == py:
            return False
        
        if self.rank[px] < self.rank[py]:
            self.parent[px] = py
        elif self.rank[px] > self.rank[py]:
            self.parent[py] = px
        else:
            self.parent[py] = px
            self.rank[px] += 1
        return True

def road_construction_optimized(n, m, roads):
    # Sort roads by cost
    roads.sort(key=lambda x: x[2])
    
    # Optimized Union-Find
    uf = UnionFind(n)
    
    # Kruskal's algorithm
    total_cost = 0
    edges_used = 0
    
    for a, b, cost in roads:
        if uf.union(a, b):
            total_cost += cost
            edges_used += 1
    
    # Check if all cities are connected
    if edges_used == n - 1:
        return total_cost
    else:
        return "IMPOSSIBLE"

def solve_road_construction_iv():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    roads = []
    for _ in range(m):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        roads.append((a, b, c))
    
    result = road_construction_optimized(n, m, roads)
    print(result)

# Main execution
if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve_road_construction_iv()
```

**Time Complexity:** O(m log m) for sorting + O(m Œ±(n)) for Union-Find operations
**Space Complexity:** O(n) for Union-Find data structure

**Why it's optimal:**
- Best known approach for minimum spanning tree
- Optimal time complexity O(m log m)
- Handles all edge cases correctly
- Standard method in competitive programming

### Variation 1: MST with Edge Constraints
**Problem**: Find minimum spanning tree with constraints on edge types or city connections.

**Link**: [CSES Problem Set - MST with Edge Constraints](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/mst_edge_constraints)

    # constraints = {'max_edges': x, 'forbidden_edges': [(a, b), ...], 'required_edges': [(a, b), ...]}
