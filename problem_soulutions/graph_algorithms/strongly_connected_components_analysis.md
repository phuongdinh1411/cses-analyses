## Problem Description

**Problem**: Given a directed graph with n nodes and m edges, find all strongly connected components (SCCs). A strongly connected component is a subset of vertices where every vertex is reachable from every other vertex in the component.

**Input**: 
- First line: Two integers n and m (number of nodes and edges)
- Next m lines: Two integers a and b (edge from node a to node b)

**Output**: 
- First line: Number of SCCs
- Next lines: Nodes in each component

**Constraints**:
- 1 ‚â§ n ‚â§ 10‚Åµ
- 1 ‚â§ m ‚â§ 2‚ãÖ10‚Åµ
- 1 ‚â§ a, b ‚â§ n
- Graph is directed
- Nodes are numbered from 1 to n

**Example**:
```
Input:
5 5
1 2
2 3
3 1
3 4
4 5

Output:
3
1 2 3
4
5
```

**Explanation**: 
- Component 1: Nodes 1, 2, 3 form a cycle (1‚Üí2‚Üí3‚Üí1)
- Component 2: Node 4 (can reach 5 but can't be reached from 1,2,3)
- Component 3: Node 5 (can't reach any other nodes)
- Total: 3 strongly connected components

## Visual Example

Nodes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
Edges: (1‚Üí2), (2‚Üí3), (3‚Üí1), (3‚Üí4), (4‚Üí5)

Graph representation:
1 ‚îÄ‚îÄ> 2 ‚îÄ‚îÄ> 3 ‚îÄ‚îÄ> 4 ‚îÄ‚îÄ> 5
‚îÇ     ‚îÇ     ‚îÇ

      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò
```

### Strongly Connected Components (SCCs) Detection
```
Step 1: Build adjacency lists
- Node 1: [2]
- Node 2: [3]
- Node 3: [1, 4]
- Node 4: [5]
- Node 5: []

Step 2: First DFS pass (finish times)
- Start from node 1: 1 ‚Üí 2 ‚Üí 3 ‚Üí 1 (cycle detected)
- Finish times: [3, 2, 1, 4, 5]

Step 3: Build transpose graph
- Node 1: [3]
- Node 2: [1]
- Node 3: [2]
- Node 4: [3]
- Node 5: [4]

Step 4: Second DFS pass (SCCs)
- Process in reverse finish time order: [5, 4, 1, 2, 3]
- Node 5: SCC 1 (only itself)
- Node 4: SCC 2 (only itself)
- Node 1: SCC 3 (1 ‚Üí 2 ‚Üí 3 ‚Üí 1)
- Node 2: already in SCC 3
- Node 3: already in SCC 3
```

### SCC Analysis
```
Strongly Connected Components:
- SCC 1: {5}
- SCC 2: {4}
- SCC 3: {1, 2, 3}

Component verification:
- SCC 1: Node 5 can reach itself ‚úì
- SCC 2: Node 4 can reach itself ‚úì
- SCC 3: All nodes can reach each other ‚úì
  - 1 ‚Üí 2 ‚Üí 3 ‚Üí 1
  - 2 ‚Üí 3 ‚Üí 1 ‚Üí 2
  - 3 ‚Üí 1 ‚Üí 2 ‚Üí 3
```

## üîç Solution Analysis: From Brute Force to Optimal

### Approach 1: Brute Force SCC Detection (Inefficient)

**Key Insights from Brute Force Solution:**
- Check all possible pairs of nodes to determine if they are in the same SCC
- Use Floyd-Warshall algorithm to find all-pairs reachability
- Group nodes that can reach each other into components
- Simple but computationally expensive approach

**Algorithm:**
1. Build adjacency matrix from edges
2. Use Floyd-Warshall to find all-pairs reachability
3. Group nodes that can reach each other bidirectionally
4. Return strongly connected components

**Visual Example:**
```
Brute force: Check all pairs
For nodes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 with edges (1‚Üí2), (2‚Üí3), (3‚Üí1), (3‚Üí4), (4‚Üí5)

Reachability Matrix (after Floyd-Warshall):
    1  2  3  4  5
1 [ 1  1  1  1  1 ]
2 [ 1  1  1  1  1 ]
3 [ 1  1  1  1  1 ]
4 [ 0  0  0  1  1 ]
5 [ 0  0  0  0  1 ]

SCCs: {1,2,3} and {4} and {5} ‚Üí 3 components
```

**Implementation:**
```python
def strongly_connected_components_brute_force(n, m, edges):
    # Build adjacency matrix
    adj = [[False] * (n + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for a, b in edges:
        adj[a][b] = True
    
    # Floyd-Warshall for all-pairs reachability
    for k in range(1, n + 1):
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
            for j in range(1, n + 1):
                if adj[i][k] and adj[k][j]:
                    adj[i][j] = True
    
    # Find SCCs by checking bidirectional reachability
    visited = [False] * (n + 1)
    sccs = []
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if not visited[i]:
            component = []
            for j in range(1, n + 1):
                if adj[i][j] and adj[j][i]:  # Bidirectional reachability
                    component.append(j)
                    visited[j] = True
            sccs.append(component)
    
    return sccs
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n¬≥) for Floyd-Warshall algorithm
**Space Complexity:** O(n¬≤) for adjacency matrix

**Why it's inefficient:**
- Uses O(n¬≤) space for adjacency matrix
- O(n¬≥) time complexity is too slow for large graphs
- Not suitable for competitive programming
- Overkill for this specific problem

### Approach 2: Kosaraju's Algorithm (Better)

**Key Insights from Kosaraju's Solution:**
- Use two DFS passes to find strongly connected components
- First DFS to get topological order of finish times
- Build transpose graph (reverse all edges)
- Second DFS on transpose graph in reverse finish time order
- Much more efficient than brute force approach

**Algorithm:**
1. Build adjacency lists for original and transpose graphs
2. First DFS to get finish times (topological order)
3. Build transpose graph by reversing all edges
4. Second DFS on transpose graph in reverse finish time order
5. Each DFS tree in second pass forms an SCC

**Visual Example:**
```
Kosaraju's algorithm for nodes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 with edges (1‚Üí2), (2‚Üí3), (3‚Üí1), (3‚Üí4), (4‚Üí5)

Step 1: First DFS (finish times)
- DFS from 1: 1 ‚Üí 2 ‚Üí 3 ‚Üí 1 (cycle), finish times: [3, 2, 1, 4, 5]

Step 2: Build transpose graph
- Original: 1‚Üí2, 2‚Üí3, 3‚Üí1, 3‚Üí4, 4‚Üí5
- Transpose: 2‚Üí1, 3‚Üí2, 1‚Üí3, 4‚Üí3, 5‚Üí4

Step 3: Second DFS (reverse finish time order: [5, 4, 1, 2, 3])
- DFS from 5: SCC 1 = {5}
- DFS from 4: SCC 2 = {4}
- DFS from 1: SCC 3 = {1, 2, 3}
```

**Implementation:**
```python
def strongly_connected_components_kosaraju(n, m, edges):
    # Build adjacency lists
    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    adj_rev = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    
    for a, b in edges:
        adj[a].append(b)
        adj_rev[b].append(a)
    
    # First DFS to get finish times
    visited = [False] * (n + 1)
    finish_order = []
    
    def first_dfs(node):
        visited[node] = True
        for neighbor in adj[node]:
            if not visited[neighbor]:
                first_dfs(neighbor)
        finish_order.append(node)
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if not visited[i]:
            first_dfs(i)
    
    # Second DFS on reversed graph
    visited = [False] * (n + 1)
    sccs = []
    
    def second_dfs(node, component):
        visited[node] = True
        component.append(node)
        for neighbor in adj_rev[node]:
            if not visited[neighbor]:
                second_dfs(neighbor, component)
    
    for node in reversed(finish_order):
        if not visited[node]:
            component = []
            second_dfs(node, component)
            sccs.append(component)
    
    return sccs
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n + m) for two DFS traversals
**Space Complexity:** O(n + m) for adjacency lists and visited arrays

**Why it's better:**
- Uses O(n + m) space instead of O(n¬≤)
- O(n + m) time complexity is optimal
- Simple and intuitive two-pass approach
- Standard method for SCC detection

### Approach 3: Tarjan's Algorithm (Optimal)

**Key Insights from Tarjan's Solution:**
- Use single DFS with stack and low-link values
- Track discovery time and low-link value for each node
- Use stack to keep track of current SCC
- Most efficient approach for SCC detection

**Algorithm:**
1. Use DFS with discovery time and low-link tracking
2. Maintain stack of nodes in current path
3. When low-link equals discovery time, pop stack to form SCC
4. Update low-link values during backtracking

**Visual Example:**
```
Tarjan's algorithm for nodes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 with edges (1‚Üí2), (2‚Üí3), (3‚Üí1), (3‚Üí4), (4‚Üí5)

DFS traversal with discovery times and low-link values:
- Node 1: disc=1, low=1, stack=[1]
- Node 2: disc=2, low=2, stack=[1,2]
- Node 3: disc=3, low=3, stack=[1,2,3]
- Back to 1: low[3]=1, low[2]=1, low[1]=1
- SCC found: {1,2,3}
- Node 4: disc=4, low=4, stack=[4]
- Node 5: disc=5, low=5, stack=[4,5]
- SCC found: {5}, then {4}
```

**Implementation:**
```python
def strongly_connected_components_tarjan(n, m, edges):
    # Build adjacency list
    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for a, b in edges:
        adj[a].append(b)
    
    # Tarjan's algorithm variables
    disc = [0] * (n + 1)  # Discovery time
    low = [0] * (n + 1)   # Low-link value
    stack = []
    in_stack = [False] * (n + 1)
    time = 0
    sccs = []
    
    def tarjan_dfs(node):
        nonlocal time
        time += 1
        disc[node] = low[node] = time
        stack.append(node)
        in_stack[node] = True
        
        for neighbor in adj[node]:
            if disc[neighbor] == 0:  # Not visited
                tarjan_dfs(neighbor)
                low[node] = min(low[node], low[neighbor])
            elif in_stack[neighbor]:  # In current stack
                low[node] = min(low[node], disc[neighbor])
        
        # If low-link equals discovery time, we found an SCC
        if low[node] == disc[node]:
            component = []
            while True:
                w = stack.pop()
                in_stack[w] = False
                component.append(w)
                if w == node:
                    break
            sccs.append(component)
            
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if disc[i] == 0:
            tarjan_dfs(i)
    
    return sccs

def solve_strongly_connected_components():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    edges = []
    for _ in range(m):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        edges.append((a, b))
    
    sccs = strongly_connected_components_tarjan(n, m, edges)
    print(len(sccs))
    for component in sccs:
        print(*component)

# Main execution
if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve_strongly_connected_components()
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n + m) for single DFS traversal
**Space Complexity:** O(n + m) for adjacency list and stack

**Why it's optimal:**
- Single DFS pass instead of two
- O(n + m) time complexity is optimal
- More memory efficient than Kosaraju's
- Standard method in competitive programming

The key insights include understanding strongly connected components as maximal subgraphs where every node can reach every other node, using DFS-based algorithms for efficient detection, and applying graph decomposition techniques. This problem serves as an excellent introduction to advanced graph algorithms and connectivity analysis.
