# Strongly Connected Components - Graph Decomposition

## üìã Problem Description

Given a directed graph with n nodes and m edges, find all strongly connected components (SCCs). A strongly connected component is a subset of vertices where every vertex is reachable from every other vertex in the component.

This is a fundamental graph theory problem that involves decomposing a directed graph into its maximal strongly connected subgraphs. SCCs are important for understanding graph structure and connectivity.

**Input**: 
- First line: Two integers n and m (number of nodes and edges)
- Next m lines: Two integers a and b (edge from node a to node b)

**Output**: 
- First line: Number of SCCs
- Next lines: Nodes in each component

**Constraints**:
- 1 ‚â§ n ‚â§ 10‚Åµ
- 1 ‚â§ m ‚â§ 2‚ãÖ10‚Åµ
- 1 ‚â§ a, b ‚â§ n

**Example**:
```
Input:
5 5
1 2
2 3
3 1
3 4
4 5

Output:
3
1 2 3
4
5
```

**Explanation**: 
- Component 1: Nodes 1, 2, 3 form a cycle (1‚Üí2‚Üí3‚Üí1)
- Component 2: Node 4 (can reach 5 but can't be reached from 1,2,3)
- Component 3: Node 5 (can't reach any other nodes)
- Total: 3 strongly connected components

## üöÄ Solution Progression

### Step 1: Understanding the Problem
- **Goal**: Find all strongly connected components in a directed graph
- **Key Insight**: Use Kosaraju's algorithm with two DFS passes
- **Challenge**: Handle large graphs efficiently and correctly identify SCCs

### Step 2: Brute Force Approach
**Use Kosaraju's algorithm to find strongly connected components:**

```python
def strongly_connected_components_naive(n, m, edges):
    # Build adjacency lists
    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    adj_rev = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    
    for a, b in edges:
        adj[a].append(b)
        adj_rev[b].append(a)
    
    # First DFS to get finish times
    visited = [False] * (n + 1)
    finish_order = []
    
    def dfs1(node):
        visited[node] = True
        for neighbor in adj[node]:
            if not visited[neighbor]:
                dfs1(neighbor)
        finish_order.append(node)
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if not visited[i]:
            dfs1(i)
    
    # Second DFS on reversed graph
    visited = [False] * (n + 1)
    sccs = []
    
    def dfs2(node, component):
        visited[node] = True
        component.append(node)
        for neighbor in adj_rev[node]:
            if not visited[neighbor]:
                dfs2(neighbor, component)
    
    for node in reversed(finish_order):
        if not visited[node]:
            component = []
            dfs2(node, component)
            sccs.append(component)
    
    return sccs
```

**Complexity**: O(n + m) - optimal for this problem

### Step 3: Optimization
**Use optimized Kosaraju's algorithm with better structure:**

```python
def strongly_connected_components_optimized(n, m, edges):
    # Build adjacency lists
    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    adj_rev = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    
    for a, b in edges:
        adj[a].append(b)
        adj_rev[b].append(a)
    
    # First DFS to get topological order
    visited = [False] * (n + 1)
    finish_order = []
    
    def first_dfs(node):
        visited[node] = True
        for neighbor in adj[node]:
            if not visited[neighbor]:
                first_dfs(neighbor)
        finish_order.append(node)
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if not visited[i]:
            first_dfs(i)
    
    # Second DFS on reversed graph to find SCCs
    visited = [False] * (n + 1)
    sccs = []
    
    def second_dfs(node, component):
        visited[node] = True
        component.append(node)
        for neighbor in adj_rev[node]:
            if not visited[neighbor]:
                second_dfs(neighbor, component)
    
    for node in reversed(finish_order):
        if not visited[node]:
            component = []
            second_dfs(node, component)
            sccs.append(component)
    
    return sccs
```

**Why this improvement works**: We use Kosaraju's algorithm which involves two DFS traversals: first to get topological order, then on the reversed graph to find SCCs.

## Final Optimal Solution

```python
n, m = map(int, input().split())
edges = []
for _ in range(m):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    edges.append((a, b))

def find_strongly_connected_components(n, m, edges):

    for a, b in edges:
        adj[a].append(b)
        adj_rev[b].append(a)
    
    # First DFS to get topological order

                first_dfs(neighbor)
        finish_order.append(node)
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if not visited[i]:
            first_dfs(i)
    
    # Second DFS on reversed graph to find SCCs
    visited = [False] * (n + 1)
    sccs = []
    
    def second_dfs(node, component):
        visited[node] = True
        component.append(node)
        for neighbor in adj_rev[node]:
            if not visited[neighbor]:
                second_dfs(neighbor, component)
    
    for node in reversed(finish_order):
        if not visited[node]:
            component = []
            second_dfs(node, component)
            sccs.append(component)
    
    return sccs

sccs = find_strongly_connected_components(n, m, edges)
print(len(sccs))
for component in sccs:
    print(*component)

def test_solution():
    # Test case 1: Simple graph with 2 SCCs
    n1, m1 = 4, 4
    edges1 = [(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (4, 1)]
    result1 = find_strongly_connected_components(n1, m1, edges1)
    print(f"Test 1: {len(result1)} SCCs")
    for i, component in enumerate(result1):
        print(f"  SCC {i+1}: {component}")
    
    # Test case 2: Single SCC
    n2, m2 = 3, 3
    edges2 = [(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1)]
    result2 = find_strongly_connected_components(n2, m2, edges2)
    print(f"\nTest 2: {len(result2)} SCCs")
    for i, component in enumerate(result2):
        print(f"  SCC {i+1}: {component}")
    
    # Test case 3: Disconnected components
    n3, m3 = 5, 2
    edges3 = [(1, 2), (4, 5)]
    result3 = find_strongly_connected_components(n3, m3, edges3)
    print(f"\nTest 3: {len(result3)} SCCs")
    for i, component in enumerate(result3):
        print(f"  SCC {i+1}: {component}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve_strongly_connected_components()
```

## Implementation Details

### 1. **Graph Representation**
- **Adjacency Lists**: We use two adjacency lists - one for the original graph and one for the reversed graph
- **Edge Storage**: Store edges in both directions for efficient traversal

### 2. **Two-Phase DFS Approach**
- **Phase 1**: Perform DFS on the original graph to get topological finish order
- **Phase 2**: Perform DFS on the reversed graph in reverse finish order to find SCCs

### 3. **SCC Identification**
- **Component Tracking**: Each DFS call in phase 2 identifies one complete SCC
- **Visited Management**: Separate visited arrays for each phase to ensure correctness

## Complexity Analysis

| Approach | Time Complexity | Space Complexity | Key Insight |
|----------|----------------|------------------|-------------|
| Kosaraju's Algorithm | O(n + m) | O(n + m) | Use two DFS traversals |
| Optimized Kosaraju's | O(n + m) | O(n + m) | Better structure and clarity |

## Key Insights

### 1. **Two-Phase DFS Strategy**
- **First Phase**: Get topological finish order from original graph
- **Second Phase**: Use reversed graph and finish order to identify SCCs
- **Key Insight**: The finish order ensures we process nodes in the correct order

### 2. **Graph Reversal for SCC Detection**
- **Reversed Edges**: Creating a reversed graph helps identify reachability
- **SCC Property**: In a reversed graph, nodes in the same SCC can still reach each other
- **Component Isolation**: Each DFS call in phase 2 identifies one complete SCC

### 3. **Efficient Component Tracking**
- **Visited Arrays**: Separate visited arrays for each phase prevent interference
- **Component Building**: Build components incrementally during DFS traversal
- **Order Dependency**: Processing nodes in reverse finish order is crucial

## Key Insights for Other Problems

**Applicable to**: SCC problems, graph decomposition problems, connectivity problems

### 3. **Graph Decomposition**
**Principle**: Decompose directed graphs into strongly connected components for analysis.

## üéØ Problem Variations & Related Questions

### üîÑ **Variations of the Original Problem**

#### **Variation 1: Strongly Connected Components with Costs**
