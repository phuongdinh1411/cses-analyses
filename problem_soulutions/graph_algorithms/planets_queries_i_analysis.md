# Planets Queries I - Binary Lifting for Path Queries

## üìã Problem Description

Given a directed graph with n planets and q queries, for each query find the k-th planet in the path starting from planet a.

**Input**: 
- First line: Two integers n and q (number of planets and queries)
- Second line: n integers t‚ÇÅ, t‚ÇÇ, ..., t‚Çô (teleporter destinations)
- Next q lines: Two integers a and k (start planet and k-th planet to find)

**Output**: 
- For each query, print the k-th planet in the path

**Constraints**:
- 1 ‚â§ n, q ‚â§ 2‚ãÖ10‚Åµ
- 1 ‚â§ t·µ¢ ‚â§ n
- 1 ‚â§ a ‚â§ n
- 1 ‚â§ k ‚â§ 10‚Åπ

**Example**:
```
Input:
4 3
2 1 4 1
1 1
1 2
1 3

Output:
2
1
2
```

**Explanation**: 
- Query 1: Start at planet 1, 1st planet in path is planet 1 itself
- Query 2: Start at planet 1, 2nd planet in path is planet 2 (1 ‚Üí 2)
- Query 3: Start at planet 1, 3rd planet in path is planet 1 (1 ‚Üí 2 ‚Üí 1)

## üöÄ Solution Progression

### Step 1: Understanding the Problem
- **Goal**: Find k-th planet in path from starting planet
- **Key Insight**: Use binary lifting for efficient ancestor queries
- **Challenge**: Handle very large k values efficiently

### Step 2: Brute Force Approach
**Simulate the path for each query:**

```python
def planets_queries_i_naive(n, q, teleporters, queries):
    results = []
    
    for a, k in queries:
        current = a
        for _ in range(k):
            current = teleporters[current - 1]
        results.append(current)
    
    return results
```

**Complexity**: O(q √ó k) - too slow for large k values

### Step 3: Optimization
**Use binary lifting to precompute ancestors:**

```python
def planets_queries_i_optimized(n, q, teleporters, queries):
    # Build binary lifting table
    log_n = 20
    up = [[0] * n for _ in range(log_n)]
    
    # Initialize first row
    for i in range(n):
        up[0][i] = teleporters[i] - 1
    
    # Build binary lifting table
    for j in range(1, log_n):
        for i in range(n):
            up[j][i] = up[j-1][up[j-1][i]]
    
    # Answer queries
    results = []
    for a, k in queries:
        current = a - 1
        for j in range(log_n):
            if k & (1 << j):
                current = up[j][current]
        results.append(current + 1)
    
    return results
```

**Key Insight**: Precompute 2^j-th ancestors for O(log k) query time

### Step 4: Complete Solution

```python
n, q = map(int, input().split())
teleporters = list(map(int, input().split()))

def answer_planets_queries(n, q, teleporters, queries):
    # Build binary lifting table
    log_n = 20
    up = [[0] * n for _ in range(log_n)]
    
    # Initialize first row
    for i in range(n):
        up[0][i] = teleporters[i] - 1
    
    # Build binary lifting table
    for j in range(1, log_n):
        for i in range(n):
            up[j][i] = up[j-1][up[j-1][i]]
    
    # Answer queries
    results = []
    for a, k in queries:
        current = a - 1
        for j in range(log_n):
            if k & (1 << j):
                current = up[j][current]
        results.append(current + 1)
    
    return results

# Read queries
queries = []
for _ in range(q):
    a, k = map(int, input().split())
    queries.append((a, k))

result = answer_planets_queries(n, q, teleporters, queries)
for res in result:
    print(res)
```

## Complexity Analysis

| Approach | Time Complexity | Space Complexity | Key Insight |
|----------|----------------|------------------|-------------|
| Naive Simulation | O(q * k) | O(1) | Simulate path for each query |
| Binary Lifting | O(n log n + q log k) | O(n log n) | Precompute ancestors for efficient queries |

## Implementation Details

### 1. **Binary Lifting Table Construction**
- **Table Structure**: 2D array where `up[j][i]` represents the 2^j-th ancestor of node i
- **Initialization**: First row contains direct teleporter destinations
- **Recursive Building**: Each row is built using the previous row: `up[j][i] = up[j-1][up[j-1][i]]`
- **Logarithmic Height**: Table height is log‚ÇÇ(n) for efficient queries

### 2. **Query Processing**
- **Binary Decomposition**: Decompose k into powers of 2 using bit manipulation
- **Ancestor Traversal**: Use the lifting table to jump 2^j steps at a time
- **Efficient Lookup**: Each query takes O(log k) time regardless of k's magnitude

### 3. **Memory Management**
- **Space Optimization**: Use 0-indexed arrays internally, convert to 1-indexed for output
- **Table Size**: O(n log n) space for the lifting table
- **Query Storage**: O(q) space for storing query results

## Key Insights

### 1. **Binary Lifting Strategy**
- **Power of 2 Decomposition**: Break down large jumps into powers of 2 for efficient traversal
- **Precomputation**: Build lookup tables to answer queries in logarithmic time
- **Recursive Structure**: Each level of the table builds upon the previous level
- **Query Efficiency**: Transform O(k) path simulation into O(log k) table lookups

### 2. **Functional Graph Properties**
- **Single Outgoing Edge**: Each planet has exactly one teleporter destination
- **Path Structure**: Paths eventually lead to cycles or fixed points
- **Cycle Detection**: Binary lifting can detect cycles by checking if 2^j-th ancestor exists
- **Efficient Simulation**: Avoid actual path traversal for large k values

### 3. **Query Optimization**
- **Bit Manipulation**: Use bitwise operations to decompose k into powers of 2
- **Table Lookup**: Access precomputed ancestors for O(1) lookup time
- **Memory Trade-off**: Use O(n log n) space to achieve O(log k) query time
- **Scalability**: Handle queries with k up to 10^9 efficiently

## Key Insights for Other Problems
