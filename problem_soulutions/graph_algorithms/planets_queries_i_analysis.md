## Problem Description

**Problem**: Given a directed graph with n planets and q queries, for each query find the k-th planet in the path starting from planet a.

This is a binary lifting problem where we need to efficiently answer k-th ancestor queries in a functional graph. Each planet has exactly one outgoing edge (teleporter), forming a functional graph structure.

**Input**: 
- First line: Two integers n and q (number of planets and queries)
- Second line: n integers t‚ÇÅ, t‚ÇÇ, ..., t‚Çô (teleporter destinations)
- Next q lines: Two integers a and k (start planet and k-th planet to find)

**Output**: 
- For each query, print the k-th planet in the path

**Constraints**:
- 1 ‚â§ n, q ‚â§ 2‚ãÖ10‚Åµ
- 1 ‚â§ t·µ¢ ‚â§ n
- 1 ‚â§ a ‚â§ n
- 1 ‚â§ k ‚â§ 10‚Åπ
- Graph is a functional graph (each vertex has exactly one outgoing edge)
- Planets are numbered 1, 2, ..., n
- Teleporters are directed edges from planet i to planet t·µ¢

**Example**:
```
Input:
4 3
2 1 4 1
1 1
1 2
1 3

Output:
2
1
2
```

**Explanation**: 
- Query 1: Start at planet 1, 1st planet in path is planet 1 itself
- Query 2: Start at planet 1, 2nd planet in path is planet 2 (1 ‚Üí 2)
- Query 3: Start at planet 1, 3rd planet in path is planet 1 (1 ‚Üí 2 ‚Üí 1)

## Visual Example

### Input Graph and Queries
```
Planets: 1, 2, 3, 4
Teleporters: [2, 1, 4, 1]
Queries: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3)

Graph representation:
1 ‚îÄ‚îÄ> 2 ‚îÄ‚îÄ> 1 ‚îÄ‚îÄ> 2 ‚îÄ‚îÄ> 1 ‚îÄ‚îÄ> ...
‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ> 3 ‚îÄ‚îÄ> 4 ‚îÄ‚îÄ> 1 ‚îÄ‚îÄ> 2 ‚îÄ‚îÄ> ...
```

### Binary Lifting Process
```
Step 1: Build binary lifting table
- up[0][i] = teleporter[i] (1 step)
- up[1][i] = up[0][up[0][i]] (2 steps)
- up[2][i] = up[1][up[1][i]] (4 steps)
- up[3][i] = up[2][up[2][i]] (8 steps)

Step 2: Process queries

Query 1: (1,1)
- Start at planet 1
- 1st planet in path: 1
- Result: 1

Query 2: (1,2)
- Start at planet 1
- 2nd planet in path: teleporter[1] = 2
- Result: 2

Query 3: (1,3)
- Start at planet 1
- 3rd planet in path: teleporter[teleporter[1]] = teleporter[2] = 1
- Result: 1
```

### Path Visualization
```
Path from planet 1:
1 ‚Üí 2 ‚Üí 1 ‚Üí 2 ‚Üí 1 ‚Üí 2 ‚Üí 1 ‚Üí ...

Positions:
- Position 1: 1
- Position 2: 2
- Position 3: 1
- Position 4: 2
- Position 5: 1
- ...
```

### Key Insight
Binary lifting works by:
1. Precomputing powers of 2 steps for each planet
2. Using binary representation to find k-th planet
3. Time complexity: O(log k) per query
4. Space complexity: O(n √ó log n) for lifting table
5. Preprocessing: O(n √ó log n)

## üîç Solution Analysis: From Brute Force to Optimal

### Approach 1: Brute Force Path Simulation (Inefficient)

**Key Insights from Brute Force Solution:**
- Simulate the path step by step for each query
- Simple but computationally expensive approach
- Not suitable for large k values
- Straightforward implementation but poor performance

**Algorithm:**
1. For each query, start from the given planet
2. Follow the teleporter path for k steps
3. Return the k-th planet in the path
4. Handle cases where k is very large

**Visual Example:**
```
Brute force: Simulate path step by step
For query (1, 3):
- Start at planet 1
- Step 1: 1 ‚Üí 2 (teleporter[1] = 2)
- Step 2: 2 ‚Üí 1 (teleporter[2] = 1)
- Step 3: 1 ‚Üí 2 (teleporter[1] = 2)
- Result: 2

For query (1, 10^9):
- Would need to simulate 10^9 steps
- Too slow for competitive programming
```

**Implementation:**
```python
def planets_queries_i_brute_force(n, q, teleporters, queries):
    results = []
    
    for a, k in queries:
        current = a
        for _ in range(k):
            current = teleporters[current - 1]
        results.append(current)
    
    return results

def solve_planets_queries_i_brute_force():
    n, q = map(int, input().split())
    teleporters = list(map(int, input().split()))
    queries = []
    for _ in range(q):
        a, k = map(int, input().split())
        queries.append((a, k))
    
    results = planets_queries_i_brute_force(n, q, teleporters, queries)
    for result in results:
        print(result)
```

**Time Complexity:** O(q √ó k) for q queries and k steps per query
**Space Complexity:** O(1) for constant space usage

**Why it's inefficient:**
- O(q √ó k) time complexity is too slow for large k values
- Not suitable for competitive programming with k up to 10^9
- Inefficient for large inputs
- Poor performance with many queries

### Approach 2: Basic Binary Lifting (Better)

**Key Insights from Basic Binary Lifting Solution:**
- Use binary lifting to precompute powers of 2 steps
- Much more efficient than brute force approach
- Standard method for ancestor queries
- Can handle large k values efficiently

**Algorithm:**
1. Build binary lifting table with powers of 2 steps
2. For each query, use binary representation of k
3. Jump through the lifting table to find k-th planet
4. Return the result efficiently

**Visual Example:**
```
Basic Binary Lifting for query (1, 5):
- k = 5 = 101‚ÇÇ (binary)
- Start at planet 1
- Jump 1 step: 1 ‚Üí 2 (using up[0][1])
- Jump 4 steps: 2 ‚Üí 1 (using up[2][2])
- Result: 1

Binary lifting table:
up[0][i] = teleporter[i] (1 step)
up[1][i] = up[0][up[0][i]] (2 steps)
up[2][i] = up[1][up[1][i]] (4 steps)
```

**Implementation:**
```python
def planets_queries_i_basic_binary_lifting(n, q, teleporters, queries):
    # Build binary lifting table
    log_n = 20
    up = [[0] * n for _ in range(log_n)]
    
    # Initialize first row
    for i in range(n):
        up[0][i] = teleporters[i] - 1
    
    # Build binary lifting table
    for j in range(1, log_n):
        for i in range(n):
            up[j][i] = up[j-1][up[j-1][i]]
    
    # Answer queries
    results = []
    for a, k in queries:
        current = a - 1
        for j in range(log_n):
            if k & (1 << j):
                current = up[j][current]
        results.append(current + 1)
    
    return results

def solve_planets_queries_i_basic():
    n, q = map(int, input().split())
    teleporters = list(map(int, input().split()))
    queries = []
    for _ in range(q):
        a, k = map(int, input().split())
        queries.append((a, k))
    
    results = planets_queries_i_basic_binary_lifting(n, q, teleporters, queries)
    for result in results:
        print(result)
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n √ó log n) preprocessing + O(q √ó log k) for queries
**Space Complexity:** O(n √ó log n) for binary lifting table

**Why it's better:**
- O(log k) time complexity per query is much better than O(k)
- Standard method for ancestor queries
- Suitable for competitive programming
- Efficient for most practical cases

### Approach 3: Optimized Binary Lifting with Efficient Query Processing (Optimal)

**Key Insights from Optimized Binary Lifting Solution:**
- Use optimized binary lifting with efficient query processing
- Most efficient approach for ancestor queries
- Standard method in competitive programming
- Can handle the maximum constraint efficiently

**Algorithm:**
1. Use optimized binary lifting with efficient data structures
2. Implement efficient query processing with binary operations
3. Use proper preprocessing and query handling
4. Return the k-th planet efficiently

**Visual Example:**
```
Optimized Binary Lifting for query (1, 5):
- k = 5 = 101‚ÇÇ (binary)
- Start at planet 1: current = 0 (0-indexed)
- Check bit 0: k & (1 << 0) = 1, jump 1 step: current = up[0][0] = 1
- Check bit 1: k & (1 << 1) = 0, no jump
- Check bit 2: k & (1 << 2) = 1, jump 4 steps: current = up[2][1] = 0
- Result: current + 1 = 1
```

**Implementation:**
```python
def planets_queries_i_optimized_binary_lifting(n, q, teleporters, queries):
    # Build binary lifting table
    log_n = 20
    up = [[0] * n for _ in range(log_n)]
    
    # Initialize first row
    for i in range(n):
        up[0][i] = teleporters[i] - 1
    
    # Build binary lifting table
    for j in range(1, log_n):
        for i in range(n):
            up[j][i] = up[j-1][up[j-1][i]]
    
    # Answer queries efficiently
    results = []
    for a, k in queries:
        current = a - 1
        for j in range(log_n):
            if k & (1 << j):
                current = up[j][current]
        results.append(current + 1)
    
    return results

def solve_planets_queries_i():
    n, q = map(int, input().split())
    teleporters = list(map(int, input().split()))
    queries = []
    for _ in range(q):
        a, k = map(int, input().split())
        queries.append((a, k))
    
    results = planets_queries_i_optimized_binary_lifting(n, q, teleporters, queries)
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Main execution
if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve_planets_queries_i()
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n √ó log n) preprocessing + O(q √ó log k) for queries
**Space Complexity:** O(n √ó log n) for binary lifting table

**Why it's optimal:**
- O(log k) time complexity per query is optimal for ancestor queries
- Uses optimized binary lifting with efficient query processing
- Most efficient approach for competitive programming
- Standard method for ancestor query problems
