# Building Roads - Minimum Connectivity

## üìã Problem Description

There are n cities and m roads between them. Your task is to determine the minimum number of new roads that need to be built so that there is a route between any two cities.

This is a classic connectivity problem where we need to find the minimum number of edges to add to make a graph connected. The solution involves counting connected components and connecting them with the minimum number of edges.

**Input**: 
- First line: Two integers n and m (number of cities and roads)
- Next m lines: Two integers a and b (road between cities a and b)

**Output**: 
- One integer: minimum number of new roads needed

**Constraints**:
- 1 ‚â§ n ‚â§ 10‚Åµ
- 1 ‚â§ m ‚â§ 2‚ãÖ10‚Åµ

**Example**:
```
Input:
4 2
1 2
3 4

Output:
1
```

**Explanation**: 
- Cities 1 and 2 are connected (component 1)
- Cities 3 and 4 are connected (component 2)
- We need 1 road to connect these 2 components
- Result: 2 components - 1 = 1 road needed

## üéØ Solution Progression

### Step 1: Understanding the Problem
- **Goal**: Find minimum roads to connect all cities
- **Key Insight**: Count connected components and connect them with (components - 1) roads
- **Challenge**: Handle large graphs efficiently and count components accurately

### Step 2: Brute Force Approach
**Use depth-first search to find connected components and count minimum roads:**

```python
def building_roads_dfs(n, m, roads):
    # Build adjacency list
    graph = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for a, b in roads:
        graph[a].append(b)
        graph[b].append(a)
    
    def dfs(node):
        if visited[node]:
            return
        visited[node] = True
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            dfs(neighbor)
    
    visited = [False] * (n + 1)
    components = 0
    
    # Count connected components
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if not visited[i]:
            dfs(i)
            components += 1
    
    # Minimum roads needed = components - 1
    return components - 1
```

**Complexity**: O(n + m) - optimal for this problem

### Step 3: Optimization
**Use breadth-first search instead of DFS for component counting:**

```python
from collections import deque

def building_roads_bfs(n, m, roads):
    # Build adjacency list
    graph = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for a, b in roads:
        graph[a].append(b)
        graph[b].append(a)
    
    def bfs(start):
        queue = deque([start])
        visited[start] = True
        
        while queue:
            node = queue.popleft()
            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                if not visited[neighbor]:
                    visited[neighbor] = True
                    queue.append(neighbor)
    
    visited = [False] * (n + 1)
    components = 0
    
    # Count connected components
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if not visited[i]:
            bfs(i)
            components += 1
    
    # Minimum roads needed = components - 1
    return components - 1
```

**Why this improvement works**: BFS can be more memory-efficient for very large components and avoids potential stack overflow.

### Improvement 2: Union-Find (Disjoint Set) - O(n + m * Œ±(n))
**Description**: Use union-find data structure to efficiently track connected components.

```python
class UnionFind:
    def __init__(self, n):
        self.parent = list(range(n + 1))
        self.rank = [0] * (n + 1)
    
    def find(self, x):
        if self.parent[x] != x:
            self.parent[x] = self.find(self.parent[x])
        return self.parent[x]
    
    def union(self, x, y):
        px, py = self.find(x), self.find(y)
        if px == py:
            return False
        if self.rank[px] < self.rank[py]:
            self.parent[px] = py
        elif self.rank[px] > self.rank[py]:
            self.parent[py] = px
        else:
            self.parent[py] = px
            self.rank[px] += 1
        return True

def building_roads_union_find(n, m, roads):
    uf = UnionFind(n)
    
    # Union all connected cities
    for a, b in roads:
        uf.union(a, b)
    
    # Count unique components
    components = set()
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        components.add(uf.find(i))
    
    # Minimum roads needed = components - 1
    return len(components) - 1
```

**Why this improvement works**: Union-find is very efficient for connectivity queries and can handle dynamic connectivity changes.

### Alternative: Iterative DFS with Stack - O(n + m)
**Description**: Use iterative DFS to avoid recursion stack overflow.

```python
def building_roads_iterative_dfs(n, m, roads):
    # Build adjacency list
    graph = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for a, b in roads:
        graph[a].append(b)
        graph[b].append(a)
    
    def dfs_iterative(start):
        stack = [start]
        visited[start] = True
        
        while stack:
            node = stack.pop()
            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                if not visited[neighbor]:
                    visited[neighbor] = True
                    stack.append(neighbor)
    
    visited = [False] * (n + 1)
    components = 0
    
    # Count connected components
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if not visited[i]:
            dfs_iterative(i)
            components += 1
    
    # Minimum roads needed = components - 1
    return components - 1
```

**Why this works**: Iterative DFS avoids potential stack overflow for very large graphs while maintaining the same logic as recursive DFS.

### Step 4: Complete Solution

```python
n, m = map(int, input().split())
roads = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(m)]

# Build adjacency list
graph = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
for a, b in roads:
    graph[a].append(b)
    graph[b].append(a)

def dfs(node):
    if visited[node]:
        return
    visited[node] = True
    for neighbor in graph[node]:
        dfs(neighbor)

visited = [False] * (n + 1)
components = 0

# Count connected components
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    if not visited[i]:
        dfs(i)
        components += 1

# Minimum roads needed = components - 1
print(components - 1)

### Step 5: Testing Our Solution
**Let's verify with examples:**

```python
def test_solution():
    test_cases = [
        ((4, 2, [(1, 2), (3, 4)]), 1),  # 2 components, need 1 road
        ((3, 1, [(1, 2)]), 1),  # 2 components, need 1 road
        ((5, 3, [(1, 2), (2, 3), (4, 5)]), 1),  # 2 components, need 1 road
        ((4, 0, []), 3),  # 4 components, need 3 roads
        ((3, 2, [(1, 2), (2, 3)]), 0),  # 1 component, need 0 roads
    ]
    
    for (n, m, roads), expected in test_cases:
        result = find_minimum_roads(n, m, roads)
        print(f"n={n}, m={m}, roads={roads}")
        print(f"Expected: {expected}, Got: {result}")
        print(f"{'‚úì PASS' if result == expected else '‚úó FAIL'}")
        print()

def find_minimum_roads(n, m, roads):
    from collections import deque
    
    # Build adjacency list
    graph = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for a, b in roads:
        graph[a].append(b)
        graph[b].append(a)
    
    def bfs(start):
        queue = deque([start])
        visited[start] = True
        
        while queue:
            node = queue.popleft()
            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                if not visited[neighbor]:
                    visited[neighbor] = True
                    queue.append(neighbor)
    
    visited = [False] * (n + 1)
    components = 0
    
    # Count connected components
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if not visited[i]:
            bfs(i)
            components += 1
    
    # Minimum roads needed = components - 1
    return components - 1

test_solution()
```
```

## Notable Techniques

### 1. **Component Counting Pattern**
```python
def count_components(graph, n):
    visited = [False] * (n + 1)
    components = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):

        self.parent = list(range(n + 1))
        self.rank = [0] * (n + 1)
    
    def find(self, x):
        if self.parent[x] != x:
            self.parent[x] = self.find(self.parent[x])
        return self.parent[x]
    
    def union(self, x, y):
        px, py = self.find(x), self.find(y)

2. **All cities connected**: Need 0 roads
3. **Single city**: Need 0 roads
4. **Large graph**: Use efficient algorithm
5. **Disconnected components**: Count components correctly

## Problem-Solving Framework

1. **Identify connectivity nature**: This is a connected components problem
2. **Choose traversal method**: Use DFS, BFS, or Union-Find
3. **Count components**: Find number of connected components
4. **Calculate minimum roads**: Components - 1
5. **Handle edge cases**: Consider special cases

            component = []
            dfs(i, component)
            components.append(component)
    
    # Add required roads first
    required_roads = []
    for a, b in constraints.get('required_pairs', []):
        required_roads.append((a, b))
        # Update components if needed
        # (Simplified - would need to update component structure)
    
    # Calculate additional roads needed
    additional_roads_needed = len(components) - 1 - len(required_roads)

    max_roads = constraints.get('max_roads', float('inf'))
    if len(required_roads) + additional_roads_needed > max_roads:
        return -1  # Impossible
    
    return additional_roads_needed, required_roads
```

#### **Variation 3: Building Roads with Probabilities**
**Problem**: Each road has a probability of being built, find expected minimum roads needed.
```python
def probabilistic_building_roads(n, m, roads, probabilities):
    # probabilities[(a, b)] = probability that road (a, b) can be built
    
    # Use Monte Carlo simulation
    import random
    
    def simulate_road_building():
        # Randomly sample roads based on probabilities
        available_roads = []
        for a, b in roads:
            if random.random() < probabilities.get((a, b), 1.0):
                available_roads.append((a, b))
        
        # Build graph with available roads
        graph = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
        for a, b in available_roads:
            graph[a].append(b)
            graph[b].append(a)
        
        # Count components
        visited = [False] * (n + 1)
        components = 0
        
        def dfs(node):
            visited[node] = True
            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                if not visited[neighbor]:
                    dfs(neighbor)
        
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if not visited[i]:
                dfs(i)
                components += 1
        
        return max(0, components - 1)
    
    # Run multiple simulations
    num_simulations = 1000
    total_roads = 0
    
    for _ in range(num_simulations):
        roads_needed = simulate_road_building()
        total_roads += roads_needed
    
    expected_roads = total_roads / num_simulations
    return expected_roads
```

#### **Variation 4: Building Roads with Multiple Criteria**
**Problem**: Find minimum roads considering multiple criteria (cost, time, priority).
```python
def multi_criteria_building_roads(n, m, roads, criteria):
    # criteria = {'cost': costs, 'time': times, 'priority': priorities}
    
    # Build adjacency list with multiple attributes
    graph = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for a, b in roads:
        cost = criteria.get('cost', {}).get((a, b), 1)
        time = criteria.get('time', {}).get((a, b), 1)
        priority = criteria.get('priority', {}).get((a, b), 1)
        graph[a].append((b, cost, time, priority))
        graph[b].append((a, cost, time, priority))
    
    # Find connected components
    visited = [False] * (n + 1)
    components = []
    
    def dfs(node, component):
        visited[node] = True
        component.append(node)
        for neighbor, cost, time, priority in graph[node]:
            if not visited[neighbor]:
                dfs(neighbor, component)
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if not visited[i]:
            component = []
            dfs(i, component)
            components.append(component)
    
    # Calculate multi-criteria score for connecting components
    if len(components) <= 1:
        return 0, 0, 0, []
    
    best_edges = []
    total_cost = 0
    total_time = 0
    total_priority = 0
    
    for i in range(len(components) - 1):
        best_score = float('inf')
        best_edge = None
        
        for node1 in components[i]:
            for node2 in components[i + 1]:
                # Find edge between node1 and node2
                for neighbor, cost, time, priority in graph[node1]:
                    if neighbor == node2:
                        score = cost + time + priority
                        if score < best_score:
                            best_score = score
                            best_edge = (node1, node2, cost, time, priority)
                        break
        
        if best_edge:
            best_edges.append(best_edge)
            total_cost += best_edge[2]
            total_time += best_edge[3]
            total_priority += best_edge[4]
    
    return total_cost, total_time, total_priority, best_edges
```

#### **Variation 5: Building Roads with Dynamic Updates**
**Problem**: Handle dynamic updates to roads and find minimum roads needed after each update.
```python
def dynamic_building_roads(n, m, initial_roads, updates):
    # updates = [(road_to_add, road_to_remove), ...]
    
    roads = initial_roads.copy()
    results = []
    
    for road_to_add, road_to_remove in updates:
        # Update roads
        if road_to_remove in roads:
            roads.remove(road_to_remove)
        if road_to_add:
            roads.append(road_to_add)
        
        # Rebuild graph
        graph = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
        for a, b in roads:
            graph[a].append(b)
            graph[b].append(a)
        
        # Count components
        visited = [False] * (n + 1)
        components = 0
        
        def dfs(node):
            visited[node] = True
            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                if not visited[neighbor]:
                    dfs(neighbor)
        
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if not visited[i]:
                dfs(i)
                components += 1
        
        roads_needed = max(0, components - 1)
        results.append(roads_needed)
    
    return results
```
