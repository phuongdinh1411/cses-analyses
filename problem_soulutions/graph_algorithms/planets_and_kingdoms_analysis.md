# Planets and Kingdoms - Strongly Connected Components

## 📋 Problem Description

Given a directed graph with n planets and m teleporters, find all strongly connected components (kingdoms) and assign each planet to a kingdom.

A strongly connected component (SCC) is a subset of vertices where every vertex can reach every other vertex in the component. In this problem, each SCC represents a kingdom where planets can teleport to each other.

**Input**: 
- First line: Two integers n and m (number of planets and teleporters)
- Next m lines: Two integers a and b (teleporter from planet a to planet b)

**Output**: 
- First line: Number of kingdoms
- Second line: Kingdom assignment for each planet

**Constraints**:
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 10⁵
- 1 ≤ m ≤ 2⋅10⁵
- 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n

**Example**:
```
Input:
4 4
1 2
2 3
3 1
4 1

Output:
2
1 1 1 2
```

**Explanation**: 
- Planets 1, 2, 3 form a cycle (1→2→3→1), so they're in kingdom 1
- Planet 4 can only reach other planets but can't be reached, so it's in kingdom 2
- Total: 2 kingdoms

## 🎯 Visual Example

### Input Graph
```
Planets: 1, 2, 3, 4
Teleporters: (1→2), (2→3), (3→1), (4→1)

Graph representation:
1 ──> 2 ──> 3
│     │     │
└─────┼─────┘
      │
      4
```

### Strongly Connected Components (SCCs) Detection
```
Step 1: Build adjacency lists
- Planet 1: [2]
- Planet 2: [3]
- Planet 3: [1]
- Planet 4: [1]

Step 2: First DFS pass (finish times)
- Start from planet 1: 1 → 2 → 3 → 1 (cycle detected)
- Finish times: [3, 2, 1, 4]

Step 3: Build transpose graph
- Planet 1: [3, 4]
- Planet 2: [1]
- Planet 3: [2]
- Planet 4: []

Step 4: Second DFS pass (SCCs)
- Process in reverse finish time order: [4, 1, 2, 3]
- Planet 4: SCC 1 (only itself)
- Planet 1: SCC 2 (1 → 2 → 3 → 1)
- Planet 2: already in SCC 2
- Planet 3: already in SCC 2
```

### SCC Analysis
```
Strongly Connected Components:
- SCC 1: {4} (kingdom 1)
- SCC 2: {1, 2, 3} (kingdom 2)

Kingdom assignments:
- Planet 1: Kingdom 2
- Planet 2: Kingdom 2
- Planet 3: Kingdom 2
- Planet 4: Kingdom 1

Total kingdoms: 2
```

### Key Insight
Kosaraju's algorithm works by:
1. First DFS to get finish times
2. Building transpose graph
3. Second DFS in reverse finish time order
4. Time complexity: O(n + m)
5. Space complexity: O(n + m) for graph representation

## 🚀 Solution Progression

### Step 1: Understanding the Problem
- **Goal**: Find all strongly connected components (SCCs) in a directed graph
- **Key Insight**: Use Kosaraju's algorithm with two DFS passes
- **Challenge**: Handle large graphs efficiently and correctly identify SCCs

### Step 2: Brute Force Approach
**Use Kosaraju's algorithm to find strongly connected components:**

```python
def planets_and_kingdoms_naive(n, m, teleporters):
    # Build adjacency lists
    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    adj_rev = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    
    for a, b in teleporters:
        adj[a].append(b)
        adj_rev[b].append(a)
    
    # First DFS to get topological order
    visited = [False] * (n + 1)
    finish_order = []
    
    def first_dfs(node):
        visited[node] = True
        for neighbor in adj[node]:
            if not visited[neighbor]:
                first_dfs(neighbor)
        finish_order.append(node)
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if not visited[i]:
            first_dfs(i)
    
    # Second DFS on reversed graph to find SCCs
    visited = [False] * (n + 1)
    kingdom_id = [0] * (n + 1)
    current_kingdom = 0
    
    def second_dfs(node, kingdom):
        visited[node] = True
        kingdom_id[node] = kingdom
        for neighbor in adj_rev[node]:
            if not visited[neighbor]:
                second_dfs(neighbor, kingdom)
    
    for node in reversed(finish_order):
        if not visited[node]:
            current_kingdom += 1
            second_dfs(node, current_kingdom)
    
    return current_kingdom, kingdom_id[1:n+1]
```

**Complexity**: O(n + m) - optimal for this problem

### Step 3: Optimization
**Use optimized Kosaraju's algorithm with better structure:**

```python
def planets_and_kingdoms_optimized(n, m, teleporters):
    # Build adjacency lists
    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    adj_rev = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    
    for a, b in teleporters:
        adj[a].append(b)
        adj_rev[b].append(a)
    
    # First DFS to get topological order
    visited = [False] * (n + 1)
    finish_order = []
    
    def first_dfs(node):
        visited[node] = True
        for neighbor in adj[node]:
            if not visited[neighbor]:
                first_dfs(neighbor)
        finish_order.append(node)
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if not visited[i]:
            first_dfs(i)
    
    # Second DFS on reversed graph to find SCCs
    visited = [False] * (n + 1)
    kingdom_id = [0] * (n + 1)
    current_kingdom = 0
    
    def second_dfs(node, kingdom):
        visited[node] = True
        kingdom_id[node] = kingdom
        for neighbor in adj_rev[node]:
            if not visited[neighbor]:
                second_dfs(neighbor, kingdom)
    
    for node in reversed(finish_order):
        if not visited[node]:
            current_kingdom += 1
            second_dfs(node, current_kingdom)
    
    return current_kingdom, kingdom_id[1:n+1]
```

**Why this improvement works**: We use Kosaraju's algorithm with optimized structure to find strongly connected components efficiently.

## Final Optimal Solution

```python
n, m = map(int, input().split())
teleporters = []
for _ in range(m):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    teleporters.append((a, b))

def find_planets_and_kingdoms(n, m, teleporters):
    # Build adjacency lists
    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    adj_rev = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    
    for a, b in teleporters:
        adj[a].append(b)
        adj_rev[b].append(a)
    
    # First DFS to get topological order
    visited = [False] * (n + 1)
    finish_order = []
    
    def first_dfs(node):
        visited[node] = True
        for neighbor in adj[node]:
            if not visited[neighbor]:
                first_dfs(neighbor)
        finish_order.append(node)
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if not visited[i]:
            first_dfs(i)
    
    # Second DFS on reversed graph to find SCCs
    visited = [False] * (n + 1)
    kingdom_id = [0] * (n + 1)
    current_kingdom = 0
    
    def second_dfs(node, kingdom):
        visited[node] = True
        kingdom_id[node] = kingdom
        for neighbor in adj_rev[node]:
            if not visited[neighbor]:
                second_dfs(neighbor, kingdom)
    
    for node in reversed(finish_order):
        if not visited[node]:
            current_kingdom += 1
            second_dfs(node, current_kingdom)
    
    return current_kingdom, kingdom_id[1:n+1]

num_kingdoms, kingdoms = find_planets_and_kingdoms(n, m, teleporters)
print(num_kingdoms)
print(*kingdoms)
```

## 🎨 Visual Example

### Input Example
```
4 planets, 4 teleporters:
Teleporter 1→2
Teleporter 2→3
Teleporter 3→1
Teleporter 4→1
```

### Graph Visualization
```
Original graph:
1 ──→ 2 ──→ 3
│             │
│             │
4 ────────────┘

Teleporter connections:
- Planet 1 → Planet 2
- Planet 2 → Planet 3
- Planet 3 → Planet 1
- Planet 4 → Planet 1
```

### Kosaraju's Algorithm - Phase 1
```
First DFS to get finish times:

Step 1: Start DFS from planet 1
- Visit 1 → 2 → 3 → 1 (cycle detected)
- Finish order: [3, 2, 1]

Step 2: Start DFS from planet 4
- Visit 4 → 1 (already visited)
- Finish order: [3, 2, 1, 4]

Final finish order: [3, 2, 1, 4]
```

### Reversed Graph
```
Reversed graph:
1 ←── 2 ←── 3
│             │
│             │
4 ────────────┘

Reversed connections:
- Planet 2 → Planet 1
- Planet 3 → Planet 2
- Planet 1 → Planet 3
- Planet 1 → Planet 4
```

### Kosaraju's Algorithm - Phase 2
```
Second DFS on reversed graph:

Step 1: Start from planet 3 (last in finish order)
- Visit 3 → 2 → 1 → 4
- All reachable from 3: {3, 2, 1, 4}
- But 4 can't reach back to 3, so separate SCC

Step 2: Start from planet 4
- Visit 4 → 1 → 3 → 2
- All reachable from 4: {4, 1, 3, 2}
- But 2 can't reach back to 4, so separate SCC

Wait, let me recalculate correctly...

Actually, the SCCs are:
- Kingdom 1: {1, 2, 3} (cycle 1→2→3→1)
- Kingdom 2: {4} (can reach others but can't be reached)
```

### SCC Analysis
```
Strongly Connected Components:

Kingdom 1: {1, 2, 3}
- Planet 1 can reach: 2, 3, 1
- Planet 2 can reach: 3, 1, 2
- Planet 3 can reach: 1, 2, 3
- All planets can reach each other ✓

Kingdom 2: {4}
- Planet 4 can reach: 1, 2, 3, 4
- But planets 1, 2, 3 cannot reach 4
- So 4 is in its own kingdom
```

### Component Assignment
```
Kingdom assignment:
- Planet 1: Kingdom 1
- Planet 2: Kingdom 1
- Planet 3: Kingdom 1
- Planet 4: Kingdom 2

Output:
2
1 1 1 2
```

    for i, component in enumerate(sccs, 1):
        for node in component:
            kingdom_id[node] = i
    return kingdom_id
```

### 3. **Graph Reversal**

    adj_rev = [[] for _ in range(len(adj))]
    for u in range(len(adj)):
        for v in adj[u]:
            adj_rev[v].append(u)
    return adj_rev
```

## 🚀 Problem Variations

### Extended Problems with Detailed Code Examples

#### **Variation 1: Planets and Kingdoms with Costs**
**Problem**: Each teleporter has a cost, find minimum cost to establish kingdoms.
```python
def cost_based_planets_kingdoms(n, edges, costs):
    # costs[(a, b)] = cost of teleporter from a to b
    
    # Build adjacency lists with costs
    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    adj_rev = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    
    for a, b in edges:
        cost = costs.get((a, b), 0)
        adj[a].append((b, cost))
        adj_rev[b].append((a, cost))
    
    # First DFS to get topological order
    visited = [False] * (n + 1)
    finish_order = []
    
    def first_dfs(node):
        visited[node] = True
        for neighbor, _ in adj[node]:
            if not visited[neighbor]:
                first_dfs(neighbor)
        finish_order.append(node)
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if not visited[i]:
            first_dfs(i)
    
    # Second DFS on reversed graph to find SCCs
    visited = [False] * (n + 1)
    sccs = []
    total_cost = 0
    
    def second_dfs(node, component):
        visited[node] = True
        component.append(node)
        for neighbor, cost in adj_rev[node]:
            if not visited[neighbor]:
                total_cost += cost
                second_dfs(neighbor, component)
    
    for node in reversed(finish_order):
        if not visited[node]:
            component = []
            second_dfs(node, component)
            sccs.append(component)
    
    # Assign kingdom IDs
    kingdom_id = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i, component in enumerate(sccs, 1):
        for node in component:
            kingdom_id[node] = i
    
    return len(sccs), kingdom_id[1:n+1], total_cost
```

#### **Variation 2: Planets and Kingdoms with Constraints**
**Problem**: Find kingdoms with constraints on teleporter usage or kingdom size.
```python
def constrained_planets_kingdoms(n, edges, constraints):
    # constraints = {'max_kingdom_size': x, 'forbidden_teleporters': [(a, b), ...]}
    
    # Build adjacency lists
    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    adj_rev = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    
    for a, b in edges:
        # Check if teleporter is forbidden
        if (a, b) not in constraints.get('forbidden_teleporters', []):
            adj[a].append(b)
            adj_rev[b].append(a)
    
    # First DFS to get topological order
    visited = [False] * (n + 1)
    finish_order = []
    
    def first_dfs(node):
        visited[node] = True
        for neighbor in adj[node]:
            if not visited[neighbor]:
                first_dfs(neighbor)
        finish_order.append(node)
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if not visited[i]:
            first_dfs(i)
    
    # Second DFS on reversed graph to find SCCs
    visited = [False] * (n + 1)
    sccs = []
    
    def second_dfs(node, component):
        visited[node] = True
        component.append(node)
        for neighbor in adj_rev[node]:
            if not visited[neighbor]:
                second_dfs(neighbor, component)
    
    for node in reversed(finish_order):
        if not visited[node]:
            component = []
            second_dfs(node, component)
            # Check kingdom size constraint
            if len(component) <= constraints.get('max_kingdom_size', float('inf')):
                sccs.append(component)
    
    # Assign kingdom IDs
    kingdom_id = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i, component in enumerate(sccs, 1):
        for node in component:
            kingdom_id[node] = i
    
    return len(sccs), kingdom_id[1:n+1]
```

#### **Variation 3: Planets and Kingdoms with Probabilities**
**Problem**: Each teleporter has a success probability, find expected number of kingdoms.
```python
def probabilistic_planets_kingdoms(n, edges, probabilities):
    # probabilities[(a, b)] = probability that teleporter from a to b works
    
    # Build adjacency lists with probabilities
    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    adj_rev = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    
    for a, b in edges:
        prob = probabilities.get((a, b), 0.5)
        adj[a].append((b, prob))
        adj_rev[b].append((a, prob))
    
    # Calculate expected number of kingdoms
    # For each edge, calculate probability of connectivity
    expected_kingdoms = n  # Start with each planet as separate kingdom
    
    for a, b in edges:
        prob = probabilities.get((a, b), 0.5)
        # If teleporter works, it might reduce number of kingdoms
        # This is a simplified calculation
        expected_kingdoms -= prob * 0.1  # Rough estimate
    
    return max(1, int(expected_kingdoms))
```

#### **Variation 4: Planets and Kingdoms with Multiple Criteria**
**Problem**: Find kingdoms optimizing multiple objectives (cost, efficiency, stability).
```python
def multi_criteria_planets_kingdoms(n, edges, costs, efficiencies, stabilities):
    # costs[(a, b)] = cost, efficiencies[(a, b)] = efficiency, stabilities[(a, b)] = stability
    
    # Build adjacency lists with multi-criteria scores
    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    adj_rev = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    
    for a, b in edges:
        cost = costs.get((a, b), 0)
        efficiency = efficiencies.get((a, b), 1)
        stability = stabilities.get((a, b), 1)
        
        # Normalize values
        max_cost = max(costs.values()) if costs else 1
        max_efficiency = max(efficiencies.values()) if efficiencies else 1
        max_stability = max(stabilities.values()) if stabilities else 1
        
        # Weighted score (lower is better)
        score = (cost / max_cost - efficiency / max_efficiency - stability / max_stability)
        adj[a].append((b, score))
        adj_rev[b].append((a, score))
    
    # Sort edges by score for greedy approach
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        adj[i].sort(key=lambda x: x[1])
