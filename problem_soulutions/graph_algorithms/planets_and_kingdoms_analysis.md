# CSES Planets and Kingdoms - Problem Analysis

## Problem Statement
Given a directed graph with n planets and m teleporters, find all strongly connected components (kingdoms) and assign each planet to a kingdom.

### Input
The first input line has two integers n and m: the number of planets and teleporters.
Then there are m lines describing the teleporters. Each line has two integers a and b: there is a teleporter from planet a to planet b.

### Output
Print the number of kingdoms and then for each planet, print which kingdom it belongs to.

### Constraints
- 1 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 10^5
- 1 â‰¤ m â‰¤ 2â‹…10^5
- 1 â‰¤ a,b â‰¤ n

### Example
```
Input:
4 4

2 3
3 1
4 1

Output:
2
1 1 1 2
```

## Solution Progression

### Approach 1: Kosaraju's Algorithm - O(n + m)
**Description**: Use Kosaraju's algorithm to find strongly connected components.

```python
def planets_and_kingdoms_naive(n, m, teleporters):
    # Build adjacency lists
    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    adj_rev = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    
    for a, b in teleporters:
        adj[a].append(b)
        adj_rev[b].append(a)
    
    # First DFS to get topological order
    visited = [False] * (n + 1)
    finish_order = []
    
    def first_dfs(node):
        visited[node] = True
        for neighbor in adj[node]:
            if not visited[neighbor]:
                first_dfs(neighbor)
        finish_order.append(node)
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if not visited[i]:
            first_dfs(i)
    
    # Second DFS on reversed graph to find SCCs
    visited = [False] * (n + 1)
    kingdom_id = [0] * (n + 1)
    current_kingdom = 0
    
    def second_dfs(node, kingdom):
        visited[node] = True
        kingdom_id[node] = kingdom
        for neighbor in adj_rev[node]:
            if not visited[neighbor]:
                second_dfs(neighbor, kingdom)
    
    for node in reversed(finish_order):
        if not visited[node]:
            current_kingdom += 1
            second_dfs(node, current_kingdom)
    
    return current_kingdom, kingdom_id[1:n+1]
```

**Why this is inefficient**: The implementation is correct but can be optimized for clarity.

### Improvement 1: Optimized Kosaraju's Algorithm - O(n + m)
**Description**: Use optimized Kosaraju's algorithm with better structure.

```python
def planets_and_kingdoms_optimized(n, m, teleporters):
    # Build adjacency lists
    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    adj_rev = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    
    for a, b in teleporters:
        adj[a].append(b)
        adj_rev[b].append(a)
    
    # First DFS to get topological order
    visited = [False] * (n + 1)
    finish_order = []
    
    def first_dfs(node):
        visited[node] = True
        for neighbor in adj[node]:
            if not visited[neighbor]:
                first_dfs(neighbor)
        finish_order.append(node)
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if not visited[i]:
            first_dfs(i)
    
    # Second DFS on reversed graph to find SCCs
    visited = [False] * (n + 1)
    kingdom_id = [0] * (n + 1)
    current_kingdom = 0
    
    def second_dfs(node, kingdom):
        visited[node] = True
        kingdom_id[node] = kingdom
        for neighbor in adj_rev[node]:
            if not visited[neighbor]:
                second_dfs(neighbor, kingdom)
    
    for node in reversed(finish_order):
        if not visited[node]:
            current_kingdom += 1
            second_dfs(node, current_kingdom)
    
    return current_kingdom, kingdom_id[1:n+1]
```

**Why this improvement works**: We use Kosaraju's algorithm with optimized structure to find strongly connected components efficiently.

    # Second DFS on reversed graph to find SCCs
    visited = [False] * (n + 1)
    kingdom_id = [0] * (n + 1)

        for neighbor in adj_rev[node]:
            if not visited[neighbor]:
                second_dfs(neighbor, kingdom)
    
    for node in reversed(finish_order):
        if not visited[node]:
            current_kingdom += 1
            second_dfs(node, current_kingdom)
    
    return current_kingdom, kingdom_id[1:n+1]

num_kingdoms, kingdoms = find_planets_and_kingdoms(n, m, teleporters)
print(num_kingdoms)
print(*kingdoms)
```
