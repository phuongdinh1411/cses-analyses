## 🔍 Solution Analysis: From Brute Force to Optimal

### Approach 1: Brute Force Solution

**Key Insights from Brute Force Solution**:
- **Complete Enumeration**: Check all possible paths between vertices
- **Simple Implementation**: Easy to understand and implement
- **Direct Calculation**: Use basic graph traversal
- **Inefficient**: O(n³) time complexity

**Key Insight**: For each vertex, check if it can reach all other vertices in its component.

**Algorithm**:
- For each vertex, perform DFS to find reachable vertices
- Check if the reachable set forms a strongly connected component
- Group vertices into components

**Visual Example**:
```
Graph: 0->1->2->0, 1->3, 3->4

SCC detection:
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Vertex 0: can reach [0,1,2]        │
│ Vertex 1: can reach [0,1,2,3,4]    │
│ Vertex 2: can reach [0,1,2]        │
│ Vertex 3: can reach [3,4]          │
│ Vertex 4: can reach [4]            │
│                                   │
│ SCC 1: [0,1,2] (mutually reachable) │
│ SCC 2: [3] (single vertex)        │
│ SCC 3: [4] (single vertex)        │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Implementation**:
```python
def brute_force_planets_and_kingdoms(n, edges):
    """Find SCCs using brute force approach"""
    # Build adjacency list
    adj = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for u, v in edges:
        adj[u].append(v)
    
    def dfs_reachable(start, visited):
        reachable = set()
        stack = [start]
        
        while stack:
            vertex = stack.pop()
            if vertex not in visited:
                visited.add(vertex)
                reachable.add(vertex)
                for neighbor in adj[vertex]:
                    if neighbor not in visited:
                        stack.append(neighbor)
        
        return reachable
    
    # Find SCCs using brute force
    sccs = []
    visited = set()
    
    for vertex in range(n):
        if vertex not in visited:
            # Find all vertices reachable from this vertex
            reachable = dfs_reachable(vertex, set())
            
            # Check if this forms an SCC
            scc = set()
            for v in reachable:
                # Check if v can reach back to vertex
                v_reachable = dfs_reachable(v, set())
                if vertex in v_reachable:
                    scc.add(v)
            
            if scc:
                sccs.append(list(scc))
                visited.update(scc)
    
    return sccs

# Example usage
n = 5
edges = [(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (1, 3), (3, 4)]
result = brute_force_planets_and_kingdoms(n, edges)
print(f"Brute force SCCs: {result}")
```

**Time Complexity**: O(n³)
**Space Complexity**: O(n)

**Why it's inefficient**: O(n³) time complexity for checking all pairs.

### Approach 2: Kosaraju's Algorithm

**Key Insights from Kosaraju's Algorithm**:
- **Kosaraju's Algorithm**: Use Kosaraju's algorithm for efficient SCC finding
- **Two Pass DFS**: Use two passes of DFS for SCC detection
- **Efficient Implementation**: O(n + m) time complexity
- **Optimization**: Much more efficient than brute force

**Key Insight**: Use Kosaraju's algorithm for efficient SCC finding.

**Algorithm**:
- First pass: Perform DFS and store vertices in finish order
- Second pass: Perform DFS on transpose graph in reverse finish order
- Each DFS tree in second pass is an SCC

**Visual Example**:
```
Kosaraju's algorithm:

Graph: 0->1->2->0, 1->3, 3->4
Transpose: 0->2, 1->0, 2->1, 3->1, 4->3

First pass (finish order):
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ DFS from 0: finish order [2,1,0]   │
│ DFS from 3: finish order [4,3]     │
│ Complete order: [2,1,0,4,3]        │
│                                   │
│ Second pass (reverse order):       │
│ DFS from 3: SCC [3]               │
│ DFS from 4: SCC [4]               │
│ DFS from 0: SCC [0,1,2]           │
│                                   │
│ Result: [[0,1,2], [3], [4]]       │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Implementation**:
```python
def kosaraju_planets_and_kingdoms(n, edges):
    """Find SCCs using Kosaraju's algorithm"""
    # Build adjacency list
    adj = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for u, v in edges:
        adj[u].append(v)
    
    # Build transpose graph
    adj_transpose = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for u, v in edges:
        adj_transpose[v].append(u)
    
    # First pass: DFS to get finish order
    visited = [False] * n
    finish_order = []
    
    def dfs_first_pass(vertex):
        visited[vertex] = True
        for neighbor in adj[vertex]:
            if not visited[neighbor]:
                dfs_first_pass(neighbor)
        finish_order.append(vertex)
    
    for vertex in range(n):
        if not visited[vertex]:
            dfs_first_pass(vertex)
    
    # Second pass: DFS on transpose graph in reverse order
    visited = [False] * n
    sccs = []
    
    def dfs_second_pass(vertex, scc):
        visited[vertex] = True
        scc.append(vertex)
        for neighbor in adj_transpose[vertex]:
            if not visited[neighbor]:
                dfs_second_pass(neighbor, scc)
    
    # Process vertices in reverse finish order
    for vertex in reversed(finish_order):
        if not visited[vertex]:
            scc = []
            dfs_second_pass(vertex, scc)
            sccs.append(scc)
    
    return sccs

# Example usage
n = 5
edges = [(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (1, 3), (3, 4)]
result = kosaraju_planets_and_kingdoms(n, edges)
print(f"Kosaraju SCCs: {result}")
```

**Time Complexity**: O(n + m)
**Space Complexity**: O(n + m)

**Why it's better**: Uses Kosaraju's algorithm for O(n + m) time complexity.
