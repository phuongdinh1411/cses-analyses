### Approach 2: Ford-Fulkerson with BFS (Edmonds-Karp)

**Key Insights from Ford-Fulkerson with BFS**:
- **Ford-Fulkerson**: Use Ford-Fulkerson algorithm with BFS for augmenting paths
- **Efficient Implementation**: O(VE²) time complexity
- **Residual Graph**: Use residual graph to find augmenting paths
- **Optimization**: Much more efficient than brute force

**Key Insight**: Use Ford-Fulkerson algorithm with BFS to find augmenting paths efficiently.

**Algorithm**:
- Start with zero flow
- Use BFS to find augmenting paths in residual graph
- Update flow along augmenting paths
- Continue until no more augmenting paths exist

**Visual Example**:
```
Ford-Fulkerson with BFS:

Initial flow network: 0->1(3), 0->2(2), 1->2(1), 1->3(2), 2->3(3)
Initial flow: 0

Step 1: Find augmenting path using BFS
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ BFS from source 0:                  │
│ - Queue: [0]                       │
│ - Visit 0: neighbors [1, 2]        │
│ - Queue: [1, 2]                    │
│ - Visit 1: neighbors [2, 3]        │
│ - Queue: [2, 3]                    │
│ - Visit 2: neighbors [3]           │
│ - Queue: [3]                       │
│ - Visit 3: sink reached!           │
│                                   │
│ Augmenting path: 0->1->3           │
│ Bottleneck capacity: min(3, 2) = 2 │
│ Update flow: 0->1: 2, 1->3: 2     │
│ Total flow: 2                      │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

Step 2: Find another augmenting path
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ BFS from source 0:                  │
│ - Augmenting path: 0->2->3          │
│ - Bottleneck capacity: min(2, 3) = 2 │
│ - Update flow: 0->2: 2, 2->3: 2    │
│ - Total flow: 2 + 2 = 4            │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

Step 3: No more augmenting paths
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ BFS from source 0:                  │
│ - No path to sink in residual graph │
│ - Maximum flow found: 4            │

#### **3. Download Speed with Multiple Dimensions**
**Problem**: Find maximum flow in multiple dimensions.

**Key Differences**: Handle multiple dimensions

**Solution Approach**: Use advanced mathematical techniques

**Implementation**:
```python
