## 🔍 Solution Analysis: From Brute Force to Optimal

### Approach 1: Brute Force Solution

**Key Insights from Brute Force Solution**:
- **Complete Enumeration**: Try all possible paths from source to destination
- **Simple Implementation**: Easy to understand and implement
- **Direct Calculation**: Use basic graph traversal for each path
- **Inefficient**: O(n!) time complexity

**Key Insight**: Check every possible path from source to destination to count distinct routes.

**Algorithm**:
- Generate all possible paths from source to destination
- Count the number of distinct paths found
- Return the total count

**Visual Example**:
```
Graph: 0->1, 0->2, 1->3, 2->3
Source: 0, Destination: 3

All possible paths from 0 to 3:
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Path 1: 0 -> 1 -> 3                │
│ Path 2: 0 -> 2 -> 3                │
│ Path 3: 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 (invalid) │
│ Path 4: 0 -> 2 -> 1 -> 3 (invalid) │
│                                   │
│ Check each path:                   │
│ - Path 1: valid route ✓            │
│ - Path 2: valid route ✓            │
│ - Path 3: no edge 1->2 ✗          │
│ - Path 4: no edge 2->1 ✗          │
│                                   │
│ Valid routes: 1, 2                │
│ Total distinct routes: 2          │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Implementation**:
```python
def brute_force_distinct_routes(n, source, destination, edges):
    """Count distinct routes using brute force approach"""
    # Build adjacency list
    adj = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for u, v in edges:
        adj[u].append(v)
    
    def find_all_paths(current, target, visited, current_path):
        """Find all possible paths from current to target"""
        if current == target:
            return [current_path + [current]]
        
        paths = []
        for neighbor in adj[current]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                new_visited = visited | {neighbor}
                new_path = current_path + [current]
                paths.extend(find_all_paths(neighbor, target, new_visited, new_path))
        
        return paths
    
    # Find all paths from source to destination
    all_paths = find_all_paths(source, destination, {source}, [])
    
    return len(all_paths)

# Example usage
n = 4
source = 0
destination = 3
edges = [(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3)]
result = brute_force_distinct_routes(n, source, destination, edges)
print(f"Brute force distinct routes: {result}")
```

**Time Complexity**: O(n!)
**Space Complexity**: O(n)

### Approach 2: Dynamic Programming on DAG

**Key Insights from Dynamic Programming on DAG**:
- **Dynamic Programming**: Use DP to count paths efficiently
- **Efficient Implementation**: O(n + m) time complexity
- **Topological Order**: Process vertices in topological order
- **Optimization**: Much more efficient than brute force

**Key Insight**: Use dynamic programming with topological sorting to count paths efficiently.

**Algorithm**:
- Topologically sort the DAG
- Use DP where dp[v] = number of paths from source to v
- Process vertices in topological order
- Return dp[destination]

**Visual Example**:
```
Dynamic programming on DAG:

Graph: 0->1, 0->2, 1->3, 2->3
Topological order: [0, 1, 2, 3]

DP calculation:
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ dp[0] = 1 (source)                 │
│                                   │
│ Process vertex 1:                  │
│ - dp[1] += dp[0] = 1              │
│                                   │
│ Process vertex 2:                  │
│ - dp[2] += dp[0] = 1              │
│                                   │
│ Process vertex 3:                  │
│ - dp[3] += dp[1] = 1              │
│ - dp[3] += dp[2] = 1              │
│ - dp[3] = 2                       │
│                                   │
│ Result: dp[3] = 2                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Implementation**:
```python
def dp_dag_distinct_routes(n, source, destination, edges):
    """Count distinct routes using dynamic programming on DAG"""
    # Build adjacency list
    adj = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    in_degree = [0] * n
    
    for u, v in edges:
        adj[u].append(v)
        in_degree[v] += 1
    
    # Topological sorting using Kahn's algorithm
    from collections import deque
    queue = deque()
    for i in range(n):
        if in_degree[i] == 0:
            queue.append(i)
    
    topological_order = []
    while queue:
        current = queue.popleft()
        topological_order.append(current)
        
        for neighbor in adj[current]:
            in_degree[neighbor] -= 1
            if in_degree[neighbor] == 0:
                queue.append(neighbor)
    
    # Dynamic programming
    dp = [0] * n
    dp[source] = 1
    
    for vertex in topological_order:
        for neighbor in adj[vertex]:
            dp[neighbor] += dp[vertex]
    
    return dp[destination]

# Example usage
n = 4
source = 0
destination = 3
edges = [(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3)]
result = dp_dag_distinct_routes(n, source, destination, edges)
print(f"DP DAG distinct routes: {result}")
```

**Time Complexity**: O(n + m)
**Space Complexity**: O(n + m)

**Why it's better**: Uses dynamic programming for O(n + m) time complexity.
