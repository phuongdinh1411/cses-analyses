# Round Trip

## Problem Statement
Byteland has n cities and m roads between them. Your task is to find a round trip that begins in a city, goes through two or more other cities, and finally returns to the starting city. Every intermediate city must be visited exactly once.

### Input
The first input line has two integers n and m: the number of cities and roads. The cities are numbered 1,2,…,n.
Then, there are m lines describing the roads. Each line has two integers a and b: there is a road between cities a and b.

### Output
Print "IMPOSSIBLE" if there is no such round trip, and otherwise print the number of cities on the trip and the cities in the order they are visited.

### Constraints
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
- 1 ≤ m ≤ 2⋅10^5

### Example
```
Input:
5 6
1 3
1 2
5 3
1 5
2 4
4 5

Output:
4
1 3 5 1
```

## Solution Progression

### Approach 1: DFS with Cycle Detection - O(n + m)
**Description**: Use depth-first search to find a cycle in the graph.

```python
def round_trip_dfs(n, m, roads):
    # Build adjacency list
    graph = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for a, b in roads:
        graph[a].append(b)
        graph[b].append(a)
    
    def find_cycle():
        visited = [False] * (n + 1)
        parent = [-1] * (n + 1)
        cycle_start = -1
        cycle_end = -1
        
        def dfs(node, par):
            nonlocal cycle_start, cycle_end
            visited[node] = True
            parent[node] = par
            
            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                if neighbor == par:
                    continue
                
                if visited[neighbor]:
                    # Found a back edge, cycle detected
                    cycle_start = neighbor
                    cycle_end = node
                    return True
                else:
                    if dfs(neighbor, node):
                        return True
            
            return False
        
        # Try each component
        for start in range(1, n + 1):
            if not visited[start]:
                if dfs(start, -1):
                    # Reconstruct cycle
                    cycle = []
                    current = cycle_end
                    while current != cycle_start:
                        cycle.append(current)
                        current = parent[current]
                    cycle.append(cycle_start)
                    cycle.append(cycle_end)  # Complete the cycle
                    return cycle[::-1]  # Reverse to get correct order
        
        return None
    
    cycle = find_cycle()
    if cycle is None:
        return "IMPOSSIBLE"
    else:
        return f"{len(cycle)}\n{' '.join(map(str, cycle))}"
```

**Why this is efficient**: We visit each node and edge at most once, giving us O(n + m) complexity.

### Improvement 1: BFS with Cycle Detection - O(n + m)
**Description**: Use breadth-first search to find a cycle.

```python
from collections import deque

def round_trip_bfs(n, m, roads):
    # Build adjacency list
    graph = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for a, b in roads:
        graph[a].append(b)
        graph[b].append(a)
    
    def find_cycle_bfs():
        visited = [False] * (n + 1)
        parent = [-1] * (n + 1)
        
        for start in range(1, n + 1):
            if visited[start]:
                continue
            
            queue = deque([start])
            visited[start] = True
            
            while queue:
                node = queue.popleft()
                
                for neighbor in graph[node]:
                    if neighbor == parent[node]:
                        continue
                    
                    if visited[neighbor]:
                        # Found a cycle
                        cycle = []
                        current = node
                        while current != neighbor:
                            cycle.append(current)
                            current = parent[current]
                        cycle.append(neighbor)
                        cycle.append(node)  # Complete the cycle
                        return cycle[::-1]
                    else:
                        visited[neighbor] = True
                        parent[neighbor] = node
                        queue.append(neighbor)
        
        return None
    
    cycle = find_cycle_bfs()
    if cycle is None:
        return "IMPOSSIBLE"
    else:
        return f"{len(cycle)}\n{' '.join(map(str, cycle))}"
```

**Why this improvement works**: BFS can find shorter cycles and is more memory-efficient for large graphs.

### Improvement 2: Union-Find with Cycle Detection - O(n + m * α(n))
**Description**: Use union-find to detect cycles during graph construction.

```python
class UnionFind:
    def __init__(self, n):
        self.parent = list(range(n + 1))
        self.rank = [0] * (n + 1)
    
    def find(self, x):
        if self.parent[x] != x:
            self.parent[x] = self.find(self.parent[x])
        return self.parent[x]
    
    def union(self, x, y):
        px, py = self.find(x), self.find(y)
        if px == py:
            return False  # Cycle detected
        if self.rank[px] < self.rank[py]:
            px, py = py, px
        self.parent[py] = px
        if self.rank[px] == self.rank[py]:
            self.rank[px] += 1
        return True

def round_trip_union_find(n, m, roads):
    uf = UnionFind(n)
    
    # Find the edge that creates a cycle
    cycle_edge = None
    for a, b in roads:
        if not uf.union(a, b):
            cycle_edge = (a, b)
            break
    
    if cycle_edge is None:
        return "IMPOSSIBLE"
    
    # Find path between a and b using BFS
    a, b = cycle_edge
    graph = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for x, y in roads:
        if (x, y) != cycle_edge and (y, x) != cycle_edge:
            graph[x].append(y)
            graph[y].append(x)
    
    # BFS to find path from a to b
    queue = deque([(a, [a])])
    visited = [False] * (n + 1)
    visited[a] = True
    
    while queue:
        node, path = queue.popleft()
        if node == b:
            path.append(a)  # Complete the cycle
            return f"{len(path)}\n{' '.join(map(str, path))}"
        
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            if not visited[neighbor]:
                visited[neighbor] = True
                queue.append((neighbor, path + [neighbor]))
    
    return "IMPOSSIBLE"
```

**Why this improvement works**: Union-find can efficiently detect cycles during graph construction.

### Alternative: DFS with Backtracking - O(n + m)
**Description**: Use DFS with backtracking to find a cycle of minimum length.

```python
def round_trip_backtracking(n, m, roads):
    # Build adjacency list
    graph = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for a, b in roads:
        graph[a].append(b)
        graph[b].append(a)
    
    def find_min_cycle():
        min_cycle = None
        min_length = float('inf')
        
        def dfs(node, path, visited):
            nonlocal min_cycle, min_length
            
            if len(path) > 1 and node == path[0]:
                # Found a cycle
                if len(path) < min_length:
                    min_length = len(path)
                    min_cycle = path[:]
                return
            
            if len(path) >= n:  # Avoid infinite loops
                return
            
            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                if neighbor == path[-2] if len(path) > 1 else -1:
                    continue  # Don't go back to parent
                
                if neighbor in path:
                    if neighbor == path[0] and len(path) > 2:
                        # Found a cycle
                        if len(path) < min_length:
                            min_length = len(path)
                            min_cycle = path[:] + [neighbor]
                    continue
                
                dfs(neighbor, path + [neighbor], visited)
        
        for start in range(1, n + 1):
            dfs(start, [start], set())
        
        return min_cycle
    
    cycle = find_min_cycle()
    if cycle is None:
        return "IMPOSSIBLE"
    else:
        return f"{len(cycle)}\n{' '.join(map(str, cycle))}"
```

**Why this works**: This approach finds the minimum length cycle, which is often what we want.

## Final Optimal Solution

```python
n, m = map(int, input().split())
roads = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(m)]

# Build adjacency list
graph = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
for a, b in roads:
    graph[a].append(b)
    graph[b].append(a)

def find_cycle():
    visited = [False] * (n + 1)
    parent = [-1] * (n + 1)
    cycle_start = -1
    cycle_end = -1
    
    def dfs(node, par):
        nonlocal cycle_start, cycle_end
        visited[node] = True
        parent[node] = par
        
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            if neighbor == par:
                continue
            
            if visited[neighbor]:
                # Found a back edge, cycle detected
                cycle_start = neighbor
                cycle_end = node
                return True
            else:
                if dfs(neighbor, node):
                    return True
        
        return False
    
    # Try each component
    for start in range(1, n + 1):
        if not visited[start]:
            if dfs(start, -1):
                # Reconstruct cycle
                cycle = []
                current = cycle_end
                while current != cycle_start:
                    cycle.append(current)
                    current = parent[current]
                cycle.append(cycle_start)
                cycle.append(cycle_end)  # Complete the cycle
                return cycle[::-1]  # Reverse to get correct order
    
    return None

cycle = find_cycle()
if cycle is None:
    print("IMPOSSIBLE")
else:
    print(len(cycle))
    print(*cycle)
```

## Problem Variations & Related Questions

### Problem Variations

#### 1. **Round Trip with Costs**
**Variation**: Each road has a cost, find minimum cost cycle.
**Approach**: Use Floyd-Warshall or modified DFS with cost tracking.
```python
def cost_based_round_trip(n, m, roads, costs):
    # costs[(a, b)] = cost of road from a to b
    
    # Build adjacency list with costs
    graph = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for a, b in roads:
        cost = costs.get((a, b), 1)
        graph[a].append((b, cost))
        graph[b].append((a, cost))
    
    def find_min_cost_cycle():
        min_cost = float('inf')
        best_cycle = None
        
        def dfs(node, path, path_cost, visited):
            nonlocal min_cost, best_cycle
            
            if len(path) > 1 and node == path[0]:
                if len(path) > 2 and path_cost < min_cost:
                    min_cost = path_cost
                    best_cycle = path[:]
                return
            
            for neighbor, cost in graph[node]:
                if neighbor in path and neighbor != path[0]:
                    continue
                if neighbor == path[-2] if len(path) > 1 else -1:
                    continue
                
                new_cost = path_cost + cost
                if new_cost < min_cost:
                    dfs(neighbor, path + [neighbor], new_cost, visited)
        
        for start in range(1, n + 1):
            dfs(start, [start], 0, set())
        
        return best_cycle, min_cost
    
    cycle, cost = find_min_cost_cycle()
    if cycle is None:
        return "IMPOSSIBLE"
    else:
        return f"{len(cycle)}\n{' '.join(map(str, cycle))}\n{cost}"
```

#### 2. **Round Trip with Constraints**
**Variation**: Cycle must visit specific nodes or avoid certain roads.
**Approach**: Use DFS with constraint checking.
```python
def constrained_round_trip(n, m, roads, required_nodes, forbidden_roads):
    # required_nodes = set of nodes that must be visited
    # forbidden_roads = set of roads that cannot be used
    
    graph = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for a, b in roads:
        if (a, b) not in forbidden_roads and (b, a) not in forbidden_roads:
            graph[a].append(b)
            graph[b].append(a)
    
    def find_constrained_cycle():
        def dfs(node, path, visited_required):
            if len(path) > 1 and node == path[0]:
                if len(path) > 2 and visited_required == len(required_nodes):
                    return path[:]
                return None
            
            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                if neighbor in path and neighbor != path[0]:
                    continue
                if neighbor == path[-2] if len(path) > 1 else -1:
                    continue
                
                new_visited = visited_required
                if neighbor in required_nodes and neighbor not in path:
                    new_visited += 1
                
                result = dfs(neighbor, path + [neighbor], new_visited)
                if result:
                    return result
            
            return None
        
        for start in range(1, n + 1):
            visited_count = 1 if start in required_nodes else 0
            result = dfs(start, [start], visited_count)
            if result:
                return result
        
        return None
    
    cycle = find_constrained_cycle()
    if cycle is None:
        return "IMPOSSIBLE"
    else:
        return f"{len(cycle)}\n{' '.join(map(str, cycle))}"
```

#### 3. **Round Trip with Probabilities**
**Variation**: Each road has a probability of being available.
**Approach**: Use Monte Carlo simulation or expected value calculation.
```python
def probabilistic_round_trip(n, m, roads, probabilities):
    # probabilities[(a, b)] = probability road from a to b is available
    
    def monte_carlo_simulation(trials=1000):
        successful_cycles = 0
        
        for _ in range(trials):
            if can_find_cycle_with_probabilities(n, m, roads, probabilities):
                successful_cycles += 1
        
        return successful_cycles / trials
    
    def can_find_cycle_with_probabilities(n, m, roads, probs):
        # Simplified simulation
        available_roads = []
        for a, b in roads:
            if random.random() < probs.get((a, b), 1.0):
                available_roads.append((a, b))
        
        # Check if cycle exists with available roads
        graph = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
        for a, b in available_roads:
            graph[a].append(b)
            graph[b].append(a)
        
        return has_cycle(graph, n)
    
    return monte_carlo_simulation()
```

#### 4. **Round Trip with Multiple Cycles**
**Variation**: Find all cycles or the k-th shortest cycle.
**Approach**: Use DFS to find all cycles and sort by length.
```python
def multiple_cycles_round_trip(n, m, roads, k):
    graph = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for a, b in roads:
        graph[a].append(b)
        graph[b].append(a)
    
    def find_all_cycles():
        cycles = []
        
        def dfs(node, path, visited):
            if len(path) > 1 and node == path[0]:
                if len(path) > 2:
                    cycles.append(path[:])
                return
            
            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                if neighbor in path and neighbor != path[0]:
                    continue
                if neighbor == path[-2] if len(path) > 1 else -1:
                    continue
                
                dfs(neighbor, path + [neighbor], visited)
        
        for start in range(1, n + 1):
            dfs(start, [start], set())
        
        return sorted(cycles, key=len)
    
    cycles = find_all_cycles()
    if k > len(cycles):
        return "IMPOSSIBLE"
    else:
        cycle = cycles[k-1]
        return f"{len(cycle)}\n{' '.join(map(str, cycle))}"
```

#### 5. **Round Trip with Dynamic Roads**
**Variation**: Roads can appear/disappear based on time or conditions.
**Approach**: Use time-based state tracking or dynamic programming.
```python
def dynamic_roads_round_trip(n, m, roads, road_schedule):
    # road_schedule[(a, b)] = [(start_time, end_time), ...]
    
    def is_road_available(a, b, time):
        if (a, b) in road_schedule:
            for start, end in road_schedule[(a, b)]:
                if start <= time <= end:
                    return True
        return True  # Default available
    
    def find_dynamic_cycle():
        def dfs(node, path, time):
            if len(path) > 1 and node == path[0]:
                if len(path) > 2:
                    return path[:]
                return None
            
            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                if not is_road_available(node, neighbor, time):
                    continue
                if neighbor in path and neighbor != path[0]:
                    continue
                if neighbor == path[-2] if len(path) > 1 else -1:
                    continue
                
                result = dfs(neighbor, path + [neighbor], time + 1)
                if result:
                    return result
            
            return None
        
        for start in range(1, n + 1):
            result = dfs(start, [start], 0)
            if result:
                return result
        
        return None
    
    cycle = find_dynamic_cycle()
    if cycle is None:
        return "IMPOSSIBLE"
    else:
        return f"{len(cycle)}\n{' '.join(map(str, cycle))}"
```
