# Monsters - Multi-Source BFS Path Finding

## 📋 Problem Description

You are playing a game where you have a grid of size n×m. Each cell is either free (.) or a wall (#). You are initially in the upper-left corner, and you want to reach the lower-right corner. However, there are monsters that move according to a specific pattern.

Your task is to determine if it is possible to reach the destination without being caught by a monster.

This is a multi-source BFS problem where we need to find the shortest distance from monsters to each cell, then check if the player can reach the destination faster than any monster.

**Input**: 
- First line: Two integers n and m (height and width of the grid)
- Next n lines: m characters each (". " denotes free cell, "#" denotes wall, "A" denotes starting position, "M" denotes monster)

**Output**: 
- Print "YES" if it's possible to reach destination, "NO" otherwise

**Constraints**:
- 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000

**Example**:
```
Input:
5 8
########
#M..A..#
#.#.M#.#
#M#..#..
#.######

Output:
YES
```

**Explanation**: 
- Player starts at (1,4) and needs to reach (4,7)
- Monsters are at (1,1), (2,4), (3,1)
- Player can take path: (1,4) → (1,5) → (1,6) → (1,7) → (2,7) → (3,7) → (4,7)
- This path avoids monsters and reaches the destination safely

## 🎯 Solution Progression

### Step 1: Understanding the Problem
- **Goal**: Determine if player can reach destination before monsters catch them
- **Key Insight**: Use multi-source BFS to find monster distances, then check player path
- **Challenge**: Handle grid navigation and time-based path finding

### Step 2: Initial Approach
**Multi-source BFS to find monster distances to each cell:**

```python
from collections import deque

def monsters_multi_bfs(n, m, grid):
    def find_monster_distances():
        distances = [[float('inf')] * m for _ in range(n)]
        queue = deque()
        
        # Find all monsters and add them to queue
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(m):
                if grid[i][j] == 'M':
                    queue.append((i, j, 0))
                    distances[i][j] = 0
        
        # BFS to find distances from monsters
        while queue:
            row, col, dist = queue.popleft()
            
            for dr, dc in [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]:
                nr, nc = row + dr, col + dc
                if (0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < m and 
                    grid[nr][nc] != '#' and 
                    distances[nr][nc] == float('inf')):
                    distances[nr][nc] = dist + 1
                    queue.append((nr, nc, dist + 1))
        
        return distances
    
    def can_reach_destination():
        # Find start position
        start_row, start_col = -1, -1
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(m):
                if grid[i][j] == 'A':
                    start_row, start_col = i, j
                    break
            if start_row != -1:
                break
        
        monster_distances = find_monster_distances()
        
        # BFS from start to destination
        queue = deque([(start_row, start_col, 0)])
        visited = [[False] * m for _ in range(n)]
        visited[start_row][start_col] = True
        
        while queue:
            row, col, dist = queue.popleft()
            
            # Check if we reached destination
            if row == n-1 and col == m-1:
                return True
            
            for dr, dc in [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]:
                nr, nc = row + dr, col + dc
                if (0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < m and 
                    grid[nr][nc] != '#' and 
                    not visited[nr][nc] and
                    dist + 1 < monster_distances[nr][nc]):
                    visited[nr][nc] = True
                    queue.append((nr, nc, dist + 1))
        
        return False
    
    return "YES" if can_reach_destination() else "NO"
```

**Why this is efficient**: We use BFS to find distances from monsters and then check if we can reach the destination before monsters.

### Improvement 1: Optimized BFS with Early Termination - O(n*m)
**Description**: Use optimized BFS with early termination for better performance.

```python
from collections import deque

def monsters_optimized_bfs(n, m, grid):
    def find_monster_distances():
        distances = [[float('inf')] * m for _ in range(n)]
        queue = deque()
        
        # Find all monsters
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(m):
                if grid[i][j] == 'M':
                    queue.append((i, j))
                    distances[i][j] = 0
        
        # Multi-source BFS
        while queue:
            row, col = queue.popleft()
            current_dist = distances[row][col]
            
            for dr, dc in [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]:
                nr, nc = row + dr, col + dc
                if (0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < m and 
                    grid[nr][nc] != '#' and 
                    distances[nr][nc] == float('inf')):
                    distances[nr][nc] = current_dist + 1
                    queue.append((nr, nc))
        
        return distances
    
    def can_escape():
        # Find start position
        start_row, start_col = -1, -1
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(m):
                if grid[i][j] == 'A':
                    start_row, start_col = i, j
                    break
            if start_row != -1:
                break
        
        monster_distances = find_monster_distances()
        
        # Check if start is already caught
        if monster_distances[start_row][start_col] == 0:
            return False
        
        # BFS from start
        queue = deque([(start_row, start_col, 0)])
        visited = [[False] * m for _ in range(n)]
        visited[start_row][start_col] = True
        
        while queue:
            row, col, dist = queue.popleft()
            
            # Check if we reached destination
            if row == n-1 and col == m-1:
                return True
            
            # Check if we can reach border (alternative escape)
            if row == 0 or row == n-1 or col == 0 or col == m-1:
                return True
            
            for dr, dc in [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]:
                nr, nc = row + dr, col + dc
                if (0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < m and 
                    grid[nr][nc] != '#' and 
                    not visited[nr][nc] and
                    dist + 1 < monster_distances[nr][nc]):
                    visited[nr][nc] = True
                    queue.append((nr, nc, dist + 1))
        
        return False
    
    return "YES" if can_escape() else "NO"
```

**Why this improvement works**: We add early termination when reaching the border and optimize the monster distance calculation.

### Step 3: Optimization/Alternative
**BFS with priority queue for safer path exploration:**

```python
import heapq
from collections import deque

def monsters_priority_bfs(n, m, grid):
    def find_monster_distances():
        distances = [[float('inf')] * m for _ in range(n)]
        queue = deque()
        
        # Find all monsters
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(m):
                if grid[i][j] == 'M':
                    queue.append((i, j))
                    distances[i][j] = 0
        
        # Multi-source BFS
        while queue:
            row, col = queue.popleft()
            current_dist = distances[row][col]
            
            for dr, dc in [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]:
                nr, nc = row + dr, col + dc
                if (0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < m and 
                    grid[nr][nc] != '#' and 
                    distances[nr][nc] == float('inf')):
                    distances[nr][nc] = current_dist + 1
                    queue.append((nr, nc))
        
        return distances
    
    def can_escape_priority():
        # Find start position
        start_row, start_col = -1, -1
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(m):
                if grid[i][j] == 'A':
                    start_row, start_col = i, j
                    break
            if start_row != -1:
                break
        
        monster_distances = find_monster_distances()
        
        # Priority queue: (safety_margin, row, col, dist)
        pq = [(-monster_distances[start_row][start_col], start_row, start_col, 0)]
        visited = [[False] * m for _ in range(n)]
        visited[start_row][start_col] = True
        
        while pq:
            safety_margin, row, col, dist = heapq.heappop(pq)
            safety_margin = -safety_margin  # Convert back to positive
            
            # Check if we reached destination
            if row == n-1 and col == m-1:
                return True
            
            # Check if we can reach border
            if row == 0 or row == n-1 or col == 0 or col == m-1:
                return True
            
            for dr, dc in [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]:
                nr, nc = row + dr, col + dc
                if (0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < m and 
                    grid[nr][nc] != '#' and 
                    not visited[nr][nc]):
                    new_safety = monster_distances[nr][nc] - (dist + 1)
                    if new_safety > 0:
                        visited[nr][nc] = True
                        heapq.heappush(pq, (-new_safety, nr, nc, dist + 1))
        
        return False
    
    return "YES" if can_escape_priority() else "NO"
```

**Why this improvement works**: Priority queue helps us explore safer paths first, potentially finding a solution faster.

### Alternative: A* Search - O(n*m * log(n*m))
**Description**: Use A* search with heuristic for potentially faster path finding.

```python
import heapq
from collections import deque

def monsters_astar(n, m, grid):
    def manhattan_distance(row, col):
        return abs(n-1 - row) + abs(m-1 - col)
    
    def find_monster_distances():
        distances = [[float('inf')] * m for _ in range(n)]
        queue = deque()
        
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(m):
                if grid[i][j] == 'M':
                    queue.append((i, j))
                    distances[i][j] = 0
        
        while queue:
            row, col = queue.popleft()
            current_dist = distances[row][col]
            
            for dr, dc in [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]:
                nr, nc = row + dr, col + dc
                if (0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < m and 
                    grid[nr][nc] != '#' and 
                    distances[nr][nc] == float('inf')):
                    distances[nr][nc] = current_dist + 1
                    queue.append((nr, nc))
        
        return distances
    
    def astar_search():
        # Find start position
        start_row, start_col = -1, -1
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(m):
                if grid[i][j] == 'A':
                    start_row, start_col = i, j
                    break
            if start_row != -1:
                break
        
        monster_distances = find_monster_distances()
        
        # A* search: (f_score, safety_margin, row, col, g_score)
        pq = [(manhattan_distance(start_row, start_col), 
               monster_distances[start_row][start_col], 
               start_row, start_col, 0)]
        visited = [[False] * m for _ in range(n)]
        visited[start_row][start_col] = True
        
        while pq:
            f_score, safety_margin, row, col, g_score = heapq.heappop(pq)
            
            # Check if we reached destination
            if row == n-1 and col == m-1:
                return True
            
            # Check if we can reach border
            if row == 0 or row == n-1 or col == 0 or col == m-1:
                return True
            
            for dr, dc in [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]:
                nr, nc = row + dr, col + dc
                if (0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < m and 
                    grid[nr][nc] != '#' and 
                    not visited[nr][nc]):
                    new_g_score = g_score + 1
                    new_safety = monster_distances[nr][nc] - new_g_score
                    if new_safety > 0:
                        visited[nr][nc] = True
                        h_score = manhattan_distance(nr, nc)
                        f_score = new_g_score + h_score
                        heapq.heappush(pq, (f_score, new_safety, nr, nc, new_g_score))
        
        return False
    
    return "YES" if astar_search() else "NO"
```

**Why this works**: A* search uses a heuristic to guide the search toward the goal, potentially reducing the number of nodes explored.

### Step 4: Complete Solution

```python
from collections import deque

n, m = map(int, input().split())
grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]

def find_monster_distances():
    distances = [[float('inf')] * m for _ in range(n)]
    queue = deque()
    
    # Find all monsters
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if grid[i][j] == 'M':
                queue.append((i, j))
                distances[i][j] = 0
    
    # Multi-source BFS
    while queue:
        row, col = queue.popleft()
        current_dist = distances[row][col]
        
        for dr, dc in [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]:
            nr, nc = row + dr, col + dc
            if (0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < m and 
                grid[nr][nc] != '#' and 
                distances[nr][nc] == float('inf')):
                distances[nr][nc] = current_dist + 1
                queue.append((nr, nc))
    
    return distances

def can_escape():
    # Find start position
    start_row, start_col = -1, -1
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if grid[i][j] == 'A':
                start_row, start_col = i, j
                break
        if start_row != -1:
            break
    
    monster_distances = find_monster_distances()
    
    # Check if start is already caught
    if monster_distances[start_row][start_col] == 0:
        return False
    
    # BFS from start
    queue = deque([(start_row, start_col, 0)])
    visited = [[False] * m for _ in range(n)]
    visited[start_row][start_col] = True
    
    while queue:
        row, col, dist = queue.popleft()
        
        # Check if we reached destination
        if row == n-1 and col == m-1:
            return True
        
        # Check if we can reach border
        if row == 0 or row == n-1 or col == 0 or col == m-1:
            return True
        
        for dr, dc in [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]:
            nr, nc = row + dr, col + dc
            if (0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < m and 
                grid[nr][nc] != '#' and 
                not visited[nr][nc] and
                dist + 1 < monster_distances[nr][nc]):
                visited[nr][nc] = True
                queue.append((nr, nc, dist + 1))
    
    return False

print("YES" if can_escape() else "NO")
```

### Step 5: Testing Our Solution
**Test cases to verify correctness:**
- **Test 1**: Simple grid with no monsters (should return YES)
- **Test 2**: Grid with monsters blocking all paths (should return NO)
- **Test 3**: Grid where player can escape to border (should return YES)
- **Test 4**: Grid with monsters but safe path exists (should return YES)

## 🎨 Visual Example

### Input Example
```
5×8 grid:
########
#M..A..#
#.#.M#.#
#M#..#..
#.######
```

### Grid Visualization
```
Row 0: ########
Row 1: #M..A..#  ← Player at (1,4), Monster at (1,1)
Row 2: #.#.M#.#  ← Monster at (2,4)
Row 3: #M#..#..  ← Monster at (3,1)
Row 4: #.######

Legend: # = Wall, . = Free, A = Player, M = Monster
Start: (1,4), End: (4,7)
```

### Multi-Source BFS for Monster Distances
```
Step 1: Initialize monster distances
- Monsters at: (1,1), (2,4), (3,1)
- Queue: [(1,1,0), (2,4,0), (3,1,0)]
- Distances: All cells = ∞, except monster positions = 0

Step 2: BFS from all monsters simultaneously
- Process (1,1,0): Update neighbors
- Process (2,4,0): Update neighbors  
- Process (3,1,0): Update neighbors
- Continue until all cells have monster distances

Final monster distances (5×8):
Row 0: [∞,∞,∞,∞,∞,∞,∞,∞]
Row 1: [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
Row 2: [1,2,3,4,0,1,2,3]
Row 3: [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
Row 4: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
```

### Player BFS with Safety Check
```
Step 1: Start BFS from player (1,4)
- Queue: [(1,4,0)] (row, col, time)
- Visited: {(1,4)}
- Time: 0

Step 2: Process (1,4,0)
- Monster distance at (1,4): 4
- Player time: 0 < Monster time: 4 ✓ (Safe)
- Explore neighbors: (1,3), (1,5), (0,4), (2,4)
- Add to queue: [(1,3,1), (1,5,1), (2,4,1)]

Step 3: Process (1,5,1)
- Monster distance at (1,5): 5
- Player time: 1 < Monster time: 5 ✓ (Safe)
- Explore neighbors: (1,4), (1,6), (0,5), (2,5)
- Add to queue: [(1,6,2)]

Continue until reaching (4,7) or border...
```

### Path Visualization
```
########
#M..A..#
#.#.M#.#
#M#..#..
#.######

Player path: (1,4) → (1,5) → (1,6) → (1,7) → (2,7) → (3,7) → (4,7)

Time comparison:
- Player reaches (4,7) at time 6
- Monster at (1,1) reaches (4,7) at time 7
- Monster at (2,4) reaches (4,7) at time 3
- Monster at (3,1) reaches (4,7) at time 7

Player is safe! (time 6 < monster time 3 is false, but player can escape to border)
```

### Safety Margin Calculation
```
For each cell (r,c):
- Monster distance: dist_monster[r][c]
- Player distance: dist_player[r][c]
- Safety margin: dist_monster[r][c] - dist_player[r][c]

Player is safe if:
1. Safety margin > 0, OR
2. Player reaches border (escape route)
```

## Notable Techniques

### 1. **Multi-Source BFS Pattern**
```python
def multi_source_bfs(sources, graph):
    queue = deque(sources)
    distances = [float('inf')] * len(graph)
    for source in sources:
        distances[source] = 0
    
    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            if distances[neighbor] == float('inf'):
                distances[neighbor] = distances[node] + 1
                queue.append(neighbor)
    return distances
```

### 2. **Safety Margin Pattern**
```python
def calculate_safety_margin(player_pos, monster_distances, player_dist):
    return monster_distances[player_pos] - player_dist
```

### 3. **Grid BFS Pattern**
```python
def grid_bfs(grid, start, target):
    queue = deque([(start[0], start[1], 0)])
    visited = [[False] * len(grid[0]) for _ in range(len(grid))]
    visited[start[0]][start[1]] = True
    
    while queue:
        row, col, dist = queue.popleft()
        if (row, col) == target:

            if valid_cell(nr, nc, grid) and not visited[nr][nc]:
                visited[nr][nc] = True
                queue.append((nr, nc, dist + 1))
```

## Edge Cases to Remember

1. **No monsters**: Always possible to reach destination
2. **Start position is wall**: Impossible
3. **Destination is wall**: Impossible
4. **Monster at start**: Impossible
5. **Large grid**: Use efficient algorithm

## Problem-Solving Framework

1. **Identify multi-source nature**: This is a multi-source BFS problem
2. **Calculate monster distances**: Use multi-source BFS from all monsters
3. **Find player path**: Use BFS from player with safety constraints
4. **Check safety margin**: Ensure player reaches destination before monsters
5. **Handle edge cases**: Consider border escape and immediate capture

## Problem Variations & Related Questions

### Problem Variations

#### 1. **Monsters with Costs**
**Variation**: Each move has a different cost, and monsters have different speeds.

#### 2. **Monsters with Constraints**
**Variation**: Limited number of moves or specific paths must be avoided.
**Approach**: Use BFS with constraint checking and state tracking.
```python
def constrained_monsters(n, m, grid, max_moves, forbidden_paths):
    # max_moves = maximum number of moves allowed
    # forbidden_paths = set of positions that cannot be visited
    
    def find_monster_distances():
        distances = [[float('inf')] * m for _ in range(n)]
        queue = deque()
        
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(m):
                if grid[i][j] == 'M':
                    queue.append((i, j))
                    distances[i][j] = 0
        
        while queue:
            row, col = queue.popleft()
            current_dist = distances[row][col]
            
            for dr, dc in [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]:
                nr, nc = row + dr, col + dc
                if (0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < m and 
                    grid[nr][nc] != '#' and 
                    distances[nr][nc] == float('inf')):
                    distances[nr][nc] = current_dist + 1
                    queue.append((nr, nc))
        
        return distances
    
    def bfs_with_constraints():
        # Find start position
        start_row, start_col = -1, -1
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(m):
                if grid[i][j] == 'A':
                    start_row, start_col = i, j

        monster_distances = find_monster_distances()
        
        # BFS: (row, col, moves_used)
        queue = deque([(start_row, start_col, 0)])
        visited = set()
        
        while queue:
            row, col, moves = queue.popleft()
            
            if row == 0 or row == n-1 or col == 0 or col == m-1:
                return True, moves
            
            state = (row, col, moves)

                    new_safety = monster_distances[nr][nc] - (moves + 1)
                    if new_safety > 0:
                        queue.append((nr, nc, moves + 1))
        
        return False, -1
    
    success, moves = bfs_with_constraints()
    return "YES" if success else "NO", moves
```

#### 3. **Monsters with Probabilities**
**Variation**: Each monster has a probability of moving or staying still.
**Approach**: Use Monte Carlo simulation or expected value calculation.
```python
def probabilistic_monsters(n, m, grid, monster_probabilities):
    # monster_probabilities[(row, col)] = probability monster moves
    
    def monte_carlo_simulation(trials=1000):
        successful_escapes = 0
        
        for _ in range(trials):
            if can_escape_with_probabilities(n, m, grid, monster_probabilities):
                successful_escapes += 1
        
        return successful_escapes / trials
    
    def can_escape_with_probabilities(n, m, grid, probs):
        # Simplified simulation
        current_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]
        
        # Simulate monster movements
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(m):
                if current_grid[i][j] == 'M':
                    if random.random() < probs.get((i, j), 0.5):
                        # Monster moves (simplified)
                        for dr, dc in [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]:
                            nr, nc = i + dr, j + dc
                            if (0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < m and 
                                current_grid[nr][nc] == '.'):
                                current_grid[nr][nc] = 'M'
                                break
        
        # Check if escape is still possible
        return can_escape_simple(n, m, current_grid)
    
    return monte_carlo_simulation()
```

#### 4. **Monsters with Multiple Players**
**Variation**: Multiple players trying to escape simultaneously.
**Approach**: Use multi-agent pathfinding with coordination.
```python
def multi_player_monsters(n, m, grid, players):
    # players = [(row, col), ...] - positions of all players
    
    def find_monster_distances():
        distances = [[float('inf')] * m for _ in range(n)]
        queue = deque()
        
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(m):
                if grid[i][j] == 'M':
                    queue.append((i, j))
                    distances[i][j] = 0
        
        while queue:
            row, col = queue.popleft()
            current_dist = distances[row][col]
            
            for dr, dc in [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]:
                nr, nc = row + dr, col + dc
                if (0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < m and 
                    grid[nr][nc] != '#' and 
                    distances[nr][nc] == float('inf')):
                    distances[nr][nc] = current_dist + 1
                    queue.append((nr, nc))
        
        return distances
    
    def multi_agent_escape():
        monster_distances = find_monster_distances()
        escaped_players = []
        
        for player_row, player_col in players:
            # Check if this player can escape
            if can_player_escape(player_row, player_col, monster_distances):
                escaped_players.append((player_row, player_col))
        
        return escaped_players
    
    def can_player_escape(start_row, start_col, monster_distances):
        queue = deque([(start_row, start_col, 0)])
        visited = [[False] * m for _ in range(n)]
        visited[start_row][start_col] = True
        
        while queue:
            row, col, moves = queue.popleft()
            
            if row == 0 or row == n-1 or col == 0 or col == m-1:
                return True
            
            for dr, dc in [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]:
                nr, nc = row + dr, col + dc
                if (0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < m and 
                    grid[nr][nc] != '#' and 
                    not visited[nr][nc]):
                    new_safety = monster_distances[nr][nc] - (moves + 1)
                    if new_safety > 0:
                        visited[nr][nc] = True
                        queue.append((nr, nc, moves + 1))
        
        return False
    
    escaped = multi_agent_escape()
    return len(escaped), escaped
```

#### 5. **Monsters with Dynamic Movement**
**Variation**: Monsters can move dynamically based on player position.
**Approach**: Use real-time pathfinding with dynamic obstacle avoidance.
```python
def dynamic_monsters(n, m, grid, monster_behavior):
    # monster_behavior = function that determines monster movement
    
    def find_dynamic_monster_distances(player_row, player_col):
        distances = [[float('inf')] * m for _ in range(n)]
        queue = deque()
        
        # Update monster positions based on player
        current_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]
        monster_positions = []
        
        for i in range(n):

        # Move monsters based on behavior
        new_monster_positions = monster_behavior(monster_positions, player_row, player_col, current_grid)
        
        # Update grid with new monster positions
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(m):
                if current_grid[i][j] == 'M':

        while queue:
            row, col = queue.popleft()
            current_dist = distances[row][col]

        return distances, current_grid
    
    def dynamic_escape():
        # Find start position
        start_row, start_col = -1, -1
        for i in range(n):
