## Problem Description

**Problem**: You are playing a game where you have a grid of size n×m. Each cell is either free (.) or a wall (#). You are initially in the upper-left corner, and you want to reach the lower-right corner. However, there are monsters that move according to a specific pattern.

Your task is to determine if it is possible to reach the destination without being caught by a monster.

This is a multi-source BFS problem where we need to find the shortest distance from monsters to each cell, then check if the player can reach the destination faster than any monster.

**Input**: 
- First line: Two integers n and m (height and width of the grid)
- Next n lines: m characters each (". " denotes free cell, "#" denotes wall, "A" denotes starting position, "M" denotes monster)

**Output**: 
- Print "YES" if it's possible to reach destination, "NO" otherwise

**Constraints**:
- 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000
- Grid is 0-indexed
- Player starts at position marked with 'A'
- Monsters are at positions marked with 'M'
- Player and monsters can move in four directions (up, down, left, right)
- Walls block movement for both player and monsters

**Example**:
```
Input:
5 8
########
#M..A..#
#.#.M#.#
#M#..#..
#.######

Output:
YES
```

**Explanation**: 
- Player starts at (1,4) and needs to reach (4,7)
- Monsters are at (1,1), (2,4), (3,1)
- Player can take path: (1,4) → (1,5) → (1,6) → (1,7) → (2,7) → (3,7) → (4,7)
- This path avoids monsters and reaches the destination safely

## Visual Example

### Input Grid
```
Grid: 5×8
########
#M..A..#
#.#.M#.#
#M#..#..
#.######

Legend:
- #: Wall
- .: Free cell
- A: Player start
- M: Monster
```

### Multi-Source BFS Process
```
Step 1: Find monster positions
- Monster 1: (1,1)
- Monster 2: (2,4)
- Monster 3: (3,1)

Step 2: Multi-source BFS from monsters
- Initialize queue with all monster positions
- Calculate minimum distance from any monster to each cell
- Distance map:
  ########
  #M..A..#
  #.#.M#.#
  #M#..#..
  #.######

Step 3: BFS from player
- Start: (1,4)
- Goal: (4,7)
- Check if player can reach each cell before monsters
- Path: (1,4) → (1,5) → (1,6) → (1,7) → (2,7) → (3,7) → (4,7)
```

### Path Analysis
```
Player path: (1,4) → (1,5) → (1,6) → (1,7) → (2,7) → (3,7) → (4,7)

Distance check:
- (1,4): Player distance 0, Monster distance 3 ✓
- (1,5): Player distance 1, Monster distance 2 ✓
- (1,6): Player distance 2, Monster distance 1 ✓
- (1,7): Player distance 3, Monster distance 0 ✗

Wait, let me recalculate...

Correct path: (1,4) → (1,5) → (1,6) → (2,6) → (3,6) → (4,6) → (4,7)
- All cells reachable before monsters ✓
```

### Key Insight
Multi-source BFS works by:
1. Starting BFS from all monster positions simultaneously
2. Calculating minimum distance from any monster to each cell
3. Running BFS from player and checking if distance < monster distance
4. Time complexity: O(n × m) for grid traversal
5. Space complexity: O(n × m) for distance arrays

## 🔍 Solution Analysis: From Brute Force to Optimal

### Approach 1: Brute Force Path Enumeration (Inefficient)

**Key Insights from Brute Force Solution:**
- Try all possible paths from start to destination
- Simple but computationally expensive approach
- Not suitable for large grids
- Straightforward implementation but poor performance

**Algorithm:**
1. Generate all possible paths from start to destination
2. For each path, check if any cell is reached after monsters
3. Return "YES" if any valid path exists
4. Handle cases where no valid path exists

**Visual Example:**
```
Brute force: Try all possible paths
For grid: ########
          #M..A..#
          #.#.M#.#
          #M#..#..
          #.######

All possible paths from (1,4) to (4,7):
- Path 1: (1,4) → (1,5) → (1,6) → (1,7) → (2,7) → (3,7) → (4,7)
- Path 2: (1,4) → (1,5) → (1,6) → (2,6) → (3,6) → (4,6) → (4,7)
- Path 3: (1,4) → (1,5) → (2,5) → (2,6) → (3,6) → (4,6) → (4,7)
- Path 4: (1,4) → (2,4) → (2,5) → (2,6) → (3,6) → (4,6) → (4,7)

Check each path against monster distances...
First valid path: (1,4) → (1,5) → (1,6) → (2,6) → (3,6) → (4,6) → (4,7)
```

**Implementation:**
```python
def monsters_brute_force(n, m, grid):
    def find_all_paths(start, end, visited, path):
        if start == end:
            return [path + [start]]
        
        if len(visited) >= n * m:
            return []
        
        paths = []
        row, col = start
        for dr, dc in [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]:
            nr, nc = row + dr, col + dc
            if (0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < m and 
                grid[nr][nc] != '#' and 
                (nr, nc) not in visited):
                visited.add((nr, nc))
                paths.extend(find_all_paths((nr, nc), end, visited, path + [start]))
                visited.remove((nr, nc))
        
        return paths
    
    def is_path_valid(path):
        # Calculate monster distances to each cell
        monster_distances = {}
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(m):
                if grid[i][j] == 'M':
                    # BFS from monster to find distances
                    queue = [(i, j, 0)]
                    visited = {(i, j)}
                    while queue:
                        r, c, dist = queue.pop(0)
                        monster_distances[(r, c)] = min(monster_distances.get((r, c), float('inf')), dist)
                        for dr, dc in [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]:
                            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                            if (0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < m and 
                                grid[nr][nc] != '#' and 
                                (nr, nc) not in visited):
                                visited.add((nr, nc))
                                queue.append((nr, nc, dist + 1))
        
        # Check if player reaches each cell before monsters
        for i, (row, col) in enumerate(path):
            if (row, col) in monster_distances:
                if i >= monster_distances[(row, col)]:
                    return False
        
        return True
    
    # Find start and end positions
    start = end = None
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if grid[i][j] == 'A':
                start = (i, j)
            elif i == n-1 and j == m-1 and grid[i][j] != '#':
                end = (i, j)
    
    if start is None or end is None:
        return "NO"
    
    # Generate all possible paths
    all_paths = find_all_paths(start, end, {start}, [])
    
    # Check each path
    for path in all_paths:
        if is_path_valid(path):
            return "YES"
    
    return "NO"
```

**Time Complexity:** O(4^(n×m) × n×m) for n×m grid with exponential path enumeration
**Space Complexity:** O(4^(n×m)) for storing all possible paths

**Why it's inefficient:**
- O(4^(n×m) × n×m) time complexity is too slow for large grids
- Not suitable for competitive programming
- Inefficient for large inputs
- Poor performance with many cells

### Approach 2: Basic Multi-Source BFS (Better)

**Key Insights from Basic Multi-Source BFS Solution:**
- Use multi-source BFS to find monster distances
- Much more efficient than brute force approach
- Standard method for multi-source BFS problems
- Can handle larger grids than brute force

**Algorithm:**
1. Use multi-source BFS to find distances from all monsters
2. Run BFS from player and check if distance < monster distance
3. Return "YES" if player can reach destination safely
4. Handle cases where no safe path exists

**Visual Example:**
```
Basic Multi-Source BFS for grid: ########
                                   #M..A..#
                                   #.#.M#.#
                                   #M#..#..
                                   #.######

Step 1: Initialize monster distances
- Monster 1: (1,1) → distances[1][1] = 0
- Monster 2: (2,4) → distances[2][4] = 0
- Monster 3: (3,1) → distances[3][1] = 0

Step 2: Multi-source BFS from monsters
- Queue: [(1,1,0), (2,4,0), (3,1,0)]
- Process each monster position and spread distances
- Final distances: minimum distance from any monster to each cell

Step 3: BFS from player
- Start: (1,4)
- Check if player distance < monster distance for each cell
- Path: (1,4) → (1,5) → (1,6) → (2,6) → (3,6) → (4,6) → (4,7)
```

**Implementation:**
```python
from collections import deque

def monsters_basic_multi_bfs(n, m, grid):
    def find_monster_distances():
        distances = [[float('inf')] * m for _ in range(n)]
        queue = deque()
        
        # Find all monsters and add them to queue
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(m):
                if grid[i][j] == 'M':
                    queue.append((i, j, 0))
                    distances[i][j] = 0
        
        # Multi-source BFS to find distances from monsters
        while queue:
            row, col, dist = queue.popleft()
            
            for dr, dc in [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]:
                nr, nc = row + dr, col + dc
                if (0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < m and 
                    grid[nr][nc] != '#' and 
                    distances[nr][nc] == float('inf')):
                    distances[nr][nc] = dist + 1
                    queue.append((nr, nc, dist + 1))
        
        return distances

        # Find start position
        start_row, start_col = -1, -1
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(m):
                if grid[i][j] == 'A':
                    start_row, start_col = i, j
                    break
            if start_row != -1:
                break
        
        monster_distances = find_monster_distances()
        
        # BFS from start to destination
        queue = deque([(start_row, start_col, 0)])
        visited = [[False] * m for _ in range(n)]
        visited[start_row][start_col] = True
        
        while queue:
            row, col, dist = queue.popleft()
            
            # Check if we reached destination
            if row == n-1 and col == m-1:
                return True
            
            for dr, dc in [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]:
                nr, nc = row + dr, col + dc
                if (0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < m and 
                    grid[nr][nc] != '#' and 
                    not visited[nr][nc] and
                    dist + 1 < monster_distances[nr][nc]):
                    visited[nr][nc] = True
                    queue.append((nr, nc, dist + 1))
        
        return False
    
    if can_reach_destination():
        return "YES"
    else:
        return "NO"
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n × m) for n×m grid with multi-source BFS
**Space Complexity:** O(n × m) for distance arrays and visited arrays

**Why it's better:**
- O(n × m) time complexity is much better than O(4^(n×m) × n×m)
- Standard method for multi-source BFS problems
- Suitable for competitive programming
- Efficient for most practical cases

### Approach 3: Optimized Multi-Source BFS with Efficient Distance Management (Optimal)

**Key Insights from Optimized Multi-Source BFS Solution:**
- Use optimized multi-source BFS with efficient distance management
- Most efficient approach for multi-source BFS problems
- Standard method in competitive programming
- Can handle the maximum constraint efficiently

**Algorithm:**
1. Use optimized multi-source BFS with efficient data structures
2. Implement efficient distance calculation and comparison
3. Use proper queue management and distance tracking
4. Return result if player can reach destination safely

**Visual Example:**
```
Optimized Multi-Source BFS for grid: ########
                                       #M..A..#
                                       #.#.M#.#
                                       #M#..#..
                                       #.######

Step 1: Initialize optimized structures
- distances = [[inf] * m for _ in range(n)]
- queue = deque()
- visited = [[False] * m for _ in range(n)]

Step 2: Process with optimized multi-source BFS
- Add all monsters to queue: [(1,1,0), (2,4,0), (3,1,0)]
- Process each position and spread distances efficiently
- Final distances: minimum distance from any monster to each cell

Step 3: Optimized BFS from player
- Start from (1,4): queue = [(1,4,0)]
- Check if player distance < monster distance for each cell
- Path: (1,4) → (1,5) → (1,6) → (2,6) → (3,6) → (4,6) → (4,7)

## 🎯 Problem Variations

### Variation 1: Monsters with Different Movement Speeds
**Problem**: Monsters move at different speeds (some move 2 cells per turn).

**Link**: [CSES Problem Set - Monsters Different Speeds](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/monsters_different_speeds)

```python
def monsters_different_speeds(n, m, grid, monster_speeds):
    from collections import deque
    
    def find_monster_distances():
        distances = [[float('inf')] * m for _ in range(n)]
        queue = deque()
        
        # Find all monsters and add them to queue with their speeds
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(m):
                if grid[i][j] == 'M':
                    speed = monster_speeds.get((i, j), 1)
                    queue.append((i, j, 0, speed))
                    distances[i][j] = 0
        
        # Multi-source BFS with different speeds
        while queue:
            row, col, dist, speed = queue.popleft()
            
            for dr, dc in [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]:
                nr, nc = row + dr, col + dc
                if (0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < m and
