# Teleporters Path - Eulerian Trail Problem

## 📋 Problem Description

Given a directed graph with n nodes and m edges, find a path that visits every edge exactly once (Eulerian trail).

This is an Eulerian trail problem where we need to find a path that uses every edge exactly once. An Eulerian trail exists if and only if the graph is connected and has exactly 0 or 2 vertices with odd degree.

**Input**: 
- First line: Two integers n and m (number of nodes and edges)
- Next m lines: Two integers a and b (edge from node a to node b)

**Output**: 
- Print the nodes in the order they are visited in the Eulerian trail, or "IMPOSSIBLE" if no Eulerian trail exists

**Constraints**:
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 10⁵
- 1 ≤ m ≤ 2⋅10⁵
- 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n

**Example**:
```
Input:
4 4
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 1

Output:
1 2 3 4 1
```

**Explanation**: 
- The graph forms a cycle: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1
- This is an Eulerian trail that visits every edge exactly once
- All vertices have equal in-degree and out-degree

## 🎯 Solution Progression

### Step 1: Understanding the Problem
- **Goal**: Find a path that visits every edge exactly once (Eulerian trail)
- **Key Insight**: Use Hierholzer's algorithm for Eulerian trail construction
- **Challenge**: Check Eulerian trail conditions and construct the path efficiently

### Step 2: Initial Approach
**Hierholzer's algorithm for Eulerian trail construction:**

```python
def teleporters_path_naive(n, m, edges):
    # Check if Eulerian trail exists
    # All vertices except start and end must have in_degree = out_degree
    # Start vertex: out_degree = in_degree + 1
    # End vertex: in_degree = out_degree + 1
    
    in_degree = [0] * (n + 1)
    out_degree = [0] * (n + 1)
    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    
    for a, b in edges:
        out_degree[a] += 1
        in_degree[b] += 1
        adj[a].append(b)
    
    # Find start and end vertices
    start = None
    end = None
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if out_degree[i] == in_degree[i] + 1:
            if start is None:
                start = i
            else:
                return "IMPOSSIBLE"  # Multiple start vertices
        elif in_degree[i] == out_degree[i] + 1:
            if end is None:
                end = i
            else:
                return "IMPOSSIBLE"  # Multiple end vertices
        elif out_degree[i] != in_degree[i]:
            return "IMPOSSIBLE"  # Other vertices must have equal degrees
    
    if start is None or end is None:
        return "IMPOSSIBLE"
    
    # Hierholzer's algorithm
    def find_eulerian_trail():
        path = []
        stack = [start]
        
        while stack:
            current = stack[-1]
            
            if adj[current]:
                next_node = adj[current].pop()
                stack.append(next_node)
            else:
                path.append(stack.pop())
        
        return path[::-1]
    
    trail = find_eulerian_trail()
    
    # Check if all edges were used
    if len(trail) != m + 1:
        return "IMPOSSIBLE"
    
    return " ".join(map(str, trail))
```

**Why this is inefficient**: The implementation is correct but can be optimized for clarity.

### Improvement 1: Optimized Eulerian Trail Algorithm - O(n + m)
**Description**: Use optimized Hierholzer's algorithm with better degree checking.

```python
def teleporters_path_optimized(n, m, edges):
    # Check if Eulerian trail exists
    in_degree = [0] * (n + 1)
    out_degree = [0] * (n + 1)
    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    
    for a, b in edges:
        out_degree[a] += 1
        in_degree[b] += 1
        adj[a].append(b)
    
    # Find start and end vertices
    start = None
    end = None
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        diff = out_degree[i] - in_degree[i]
        if diff == 1:
            if start is None:
                start = i
            else:
                return "IMPOSSIBLE"
        elif diff == -1:
            if end is None:
                end = i
            else:
                return "IMPOSSIBLE"
        elif diff != 0:
            return "IMPOSSIBLE"
    
    if start is None or end is None:
        return "IMPOSSIBLE"
    
    # Hierholzer's algorithm
    def find_eulerian_trail():
        path = []
        stack = [start]
        
        while stack:
            current = stack[-1]
            
            if adj[current]:
                next_node = adj[current].pop()
                stack.append(next_node)
            else:
                path.append(stack.pop())
        
        return path[::-1]
    
    trail = find_eulerian_trail()
    
    if len(trail) != m + 1:
        return "IMPOSSIBLE"
    
    return " ".join(map(str, trail))
```

        return "IMPOSSIBLE"
    
    return " ".join(map(str, trail))
