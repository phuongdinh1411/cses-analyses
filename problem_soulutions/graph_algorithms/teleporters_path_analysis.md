## Problem Description

**Problem**: Given a directed graph with n nodes and m edges, find a path that visits every edge exactly once (Eulerian trail).

This is an Eulerian trail problem where we need to find a path that uses every edge exactly once. An Eulerian trail exists if and only if the graph is connected and has exactly 0 or 2 vertices with odd degree.

**Input**: 
- First line: Two integers n and m (number of nodes and edges)
- Next m lines: Two integers a and b (edge from node a to node b)

**Output**: 
- Print the nodes in the order they are visited in the Eulerian trail, or "IMPOSSIBLE" if no Eulerian trail exists

**Constraints**:
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 10⁵
- 1 ≤ m ≤ 2⋅10⁵
- 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n
- Graph is directed
- No self-loops or multiple edges between same pair of nodes
- Edges are directed from a to b

**Example**:
```
Input:
4 4
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 1

Output:
1 2 3 4 1
```

**Explanation**: 
- The graph forms a cycle: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1
- This is an Eulerian trail that visits every edge exactly once
- All vertices have equal in-degree and out-degree

## Visual Example

### Input Graph
```
Nodes: 1, 2, 3, 4
Edges: (1→2), (2→3), (3→4), (4→1)

Graph representation:
1 ──> 2 ──> 3 ──> 4
│                │
└────────────────┘
```

### Eulerian Trail Algorithm Process
```
Step 1: Check Eulerian trail conditions
- In-degrees: [1, 1, 1, 1]
- Out-degrees: [1, 1, 1, 1]
- All vertices have equal in-degree and out-degree
- Eulerian trail exists

Step 2: Find starting vertex
- Any vertex can be starting point (all have equal degrees)
- Start from vertex 1

Step 3: Hierholzer's algorithm
- Current path: [1]
- Available edges: (1→2), (2→3), (3→4), (4→1)

Step 4: Build trail
- From 1: go to 2
- Current path: [1, 2]
- Available edges: (2→3), (3→4), (4→1)

- From 2: go to 3
- Current path: [1, 2, 3]
- Available edges: (3→4), (4→1)

- From 3: go to 4
- Current path: [1, 2, 3, 4]
- Available edges: (4→1)

- From 4: go to 1
- Current path: [1, 2, 3, 4, 1]
- No more edges available

Step 5: Complete trail
- Eulerian trail: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1
- All edges visited exactly once
```

### Trail Analysis
```
Eulerian trail found:
1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1

Edges used:
- (1→2): visited once
- (2→3): visited once
- (3→4): visited once
- (4→1): visited once

All edges visited exactly once ✓
```

### Key Insight
Hierholzer's algorithm works by:
1. Checking Eulerian trail conditions
2. Starting from any vertex with odd degree (or any vertex if all even)
3. Following edges until no more edges available
4. Backtracking and inserting cycles if needed
5. Time complexity: O(m) where m is number of edges
6. Space complexity: O(n + m) for graph representation

## 🔍 Solution Analysis: From Brute Force to Optimal

### Approach 1: Brute Force Path Enumeration (Inefficient)

**Key Insights from Brute Force Solution:**
- Try all possible paths and check if they form an Eulerian trail
- Simple but computationally expensive approach
- Not suitable for large graphs
- Straightforward implementation but poor performance

**Algorithm:**
1. Generate all possible paths in the graph
2. For each path, check if it visits every edge exactly once
3. Return the first valid Eulerian trail found
4. Handle cases where no Eulerian trail exists

**Visual Example:**
```
Brute force: Try all possible paths
For graph: 1 ──> 2 ──> 3 ──> 4
           │                │
           └────────────────┘

All possible paths:
- Path 1: [1, 2, 3, 4, 1] - Check edges: (1→2), (2→3), (3→4), (4→1) ✓
- Path 2: [1, 2, 3, 4] - Check edges: (1→2), (2→3), (3→4) ✗ (missing 4→1)
- Path 3: [2, 3, 4, 1, 2] - Check edges: (2→3), (3→4), (4→1), (1→2) ✓
- Path 4: [3, 4, 1, 2, 3] - Check edges: (3→4), (4→1), (1→2), (2→3) ✓

First valid Eulerian trail: [1, 2, 3, 4, 1]
```

**Implementation:**
```python
def teleporters_path_brute_force(n, m, edges):
    def find_all_paths(start, visited_edges, path):
        if len(visited_edges) == m:
            return [path]
        
        paths = []
        for i, (a, b) in enumerate(edges):
            if i not in visited_edges and a == start:
                new_visited = visited_edges | {i}
                new_path = path + [b]
                paths.extend(find_all_paths(b, new_visited, new_path))
        
        return paths
    
    def is_eulerian_trail(path):
        if len(path) != m + 1:
            return False
        
        # Check if all edges are used exactly once
        used_edges = set()
        for i in range(len(path) - 1):
            a, b = path[i], path[i + 1]
            for j, (edge_a, edge_b) in enumerate(edges):
                if edge_a == a and edge_b == b and j not in used_edges:
                    used_edges.add(j)
                    break
            else:
                return False
        
        return len(used_edges) == m
    
    # Try starting from each vertex
    for start in range(1, n + 1):
        all_paths = find_all_paths(start, set(), [start])
        for path in all_paths:
            if is_eulerian_trail(path):
                return ' '.join(map(str, path))
    
    return "IMPOSSIBLE"
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n! × m) for n vertices and m edges with exponential path enumeration
**Space Complexity:** O(n! × m) for storing all possible paths

**Why it's inefficient:**
- O(n! × m) time complexity is too slow for large graphs
- Not suitable for competitive programming
- Inefficient for large inputs
- Poor performance with many vertices

### Approach 2: Basic Hierholzer's Algorithm (Better)

**Key Insights from Basic Hierholzer's Solution:**
- Use Hierholzer's algorithm to construct Eulerian trails
- Much more efficient than brute force approach
- Standard method for Eulerian trail problems
- Can handle larger graphs than brute force

**Algorithm:**
1. Check Eulerian trail conditions (degree requirements)
2. Find starting vertex based on degree conditions
3. Use Hierholzer's algorithm to construct the trail
4. Return the Eulerian trail if it exists

**Visual Example:**
```
Basic Hierholzer's for graph: 1 ──> 2 ──> 3 ──> 4
                               │                │
                               └────────────────┘

Step 1: Check conditions
- In-degrees: [1, 1, 1, 1]
- Out-degrees: [1, 1, 1, 1]
- All vertices have equal in-degree and out-degree ✓

Step 2: Find starting vertex
- Any vertex can be starting point (all have equal degrees)
- Start from vertex 1

Step 3: Hierholzer's algorithm
- Stack: [1]
- Current: 1, Available edges: (1→2)
- Stack: [1, 2]
- Current: 2, Available edges: (2→3)
- Stack: [1, 2, 3]
- Current: 3, Available edges: (3→4)
- Stack: [1, 2, 3, 4]
- Current: 4, Available edges: (4→1)
- Stack: [1, 2, 3, 4, 1]
- Current: 1, No available edges
- Pop: 1, Path: [1]
- Pop: 4, Path: [4, 1]
- Pop: 3, Path: [3, 4, 1]
- Pop: 2, Path: [2, 3, 4, 1]
- Pop: 1, Path: [1, 2, 3, 4, 1]
```

**Implementation:**
```python
def teleporters_path_basic_hierholzer(n, m, edges):
    # Check if Eulerian trail exists
    in_degree = [0] * (n + 1)
    out_degree = [0] * (n + 1)
    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    
    for a, b in edges:
        out_degree[a] += 1
        in_degree[b] += 1
        adj[a].append(b)
    
    # Find start and end vertices
    start = None
    end = None
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if out_degree[i] == in_degree[i] + 1:
            if start is None:
                start = i
            else:
                return "IMPOSSIBLE"  # Multiple start vertices
        elif in_degree[i] == out_degree[i] + 1:
            if end is None:
                end = i
            else:
                return "IMPOSSIBLE"  # Multiple end vertices
        elif out_degree[i] != in_degree[i]:
            return "IMPOSSIBLE"  # Other vertices must have equal degrees
    
    if start is None or end is None:
        return "IMPOSSIBLE"
    
    # Hierholzer's algorithm
    def find_eulerian_trail():
        path = []
        stack = [start]
        
        while stack:
            current = stack[-1]
            
            if adj[current]:
                next_node = adj[current].pop()
                stack.append(next_node)
            else:
                path.append(stack.pop())
        
        return path[::-1]
    
    trail = find_eulerian_trail()
    if len(trail) == m + 1:
        return ' '.join(map(str, trail))
    else:
        return "IMPOSSIBLE"
```

**Time Complexity:** O(m) for m edges with Hierholzer's algorithm
**Space Complexity:** O(n + m) for adjacency list and stack

**Why it's better:**
- O(m) time complexity is much better than O(n! × m)
- Standard method for Eulerian trail problems
- Suitable for competitive programming
- Efficient for most practical cases

**Algorithm:**
1. Use optimized Hierholzer's algorithm with efficient data structures

3. Use proper degree checking and trail validation
4. Return the Eulerian trail if it exists

**Visual Example:**

Optimized Hierholzer's for graph: 1 ──> 2 ──> 3 ──> 4
                                   │                │
                                   └────────────────┘

        return path[::-1]
    
    trail = find_eulerian_trail()
    if len(trail) == m + 1:
        return ' '.join(map(str, trail))
    else:
        return "IMPOSSIBLE"

def solve_teleporters_path():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    edges = []
    for _ in range(m):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        edges.append((a, b))
    
    result = teleporters_path_optimized_hierholzer(n, m, edges)
    print(result)
