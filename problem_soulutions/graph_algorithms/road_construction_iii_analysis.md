## Problem Description

**Problem**: Given a graph with n cities and m roads, find the minimum cost to build roads so that all cities are connected. Each road has a construction cost.

This is an advanced minimum spanning tree (MST) problem with additional complexity. We need to find the minimum cost to connect all cities while handling more sophisticated requirements.

**Input**: 
- First line: Two integers n and m (number of cities and roads)
- Next m lines: Three integers a, b, and c (road between cities a and b with cost c)

**Output**: 
- Minimum cost to build roads so all cities are connected, or "IMPOSSIBLE" if not possible

**Constraints**:
- 1 ‚â§ n ‚â§ 10‚Åµ
- 1 ‚â§ m ‚â§ 2‚ãÖ10‚Åµ
- 1 ‚â§ a, b ‚â§ n
- 1 ‚â§ c ‚â§ 10‚Åπ
- Graph is undirected
- Cities are numbered from 1 to n

**Example**:
```
Input:
4 4
1 2 1
2 3 2
3 4 3
1 4 4

Output:
6
```

**Explanation**: 
- Roads: (1,2) cost 1, (2,3) cost 2, (3,4) cost 3, (1,4) cost 4
- Minimum spanning tree: (1,2) + (2,3) + (3,4) = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6
- This connects all cities with minimum cost

## Visual Example

### Input Graph
```
Cities: 1, 2, 3, 4
Roads: (1,2,1), (2,3,2), (3,4,3), (1,4,4)

Graph representation:
1 ‚îÄ‚îÄ1‚îÄ‚îÄ 2 ‚îÄ‚îÄ2‚îÄ‚îÄ 3 ‚îÄ‚îÄ3‚îÄ‚îÄ 4
‚îÇ                    ‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ4‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò
```

### Kruskal's Algorithm Process
```
Step 1: Sort edges by weight
Edges: [(1,2,1), (2,3,2), (3,4,3), (1,4,4)]

Step 2: Initialize Union-Find
Parent: [1, 2, 3, 4] (each city is its own parent)
Rank: [0, 0, 0, 0]

Step 3: Process edges in order

Edge (1,2,1):
- Find(1) = 1, Find(2) = 2
- Different components, add edge
- Union(1,2): Parent[2] = 1, Rank[1] = 1
- MST edges: [(1,2,1)]
- Total cost: 1

Edge (2,3,2):
- Find(2) = 1, Find(3) = 3
- Different components, add edge
- Union(1,3): Parent[3] = 1, Rank[1] = 1
- MST edges: [(1,2,1), (2,3,2)]
- Total cost: 1 + 2 = 3

Edge (3,4,3):
- Find(3) = 1, Find(4) = 4
- Different components, add edge
- Union(1,4): Parent[4] = 1, Rank[1] = 2
- MST edges: [(1,2,1), (2,3,2), (3,4,3)]
- Total cost: 1 + 2 + 3 = 6

Edge (1,4,4):
- Find(1) = 1, Find(4) = 1
- Same component, skip edge
- MST edges: [(1,2,1), (2,3,2), (3,4,3)]
- Total cost: 6
```

### Final MST

Total cost: 6
All cities are connected with minimum cost.
```

## üîç Solution Analysis: From Brute Force to Optimal

### Approach 1: Brute Force MST (Inefficient)

**Key Insights from Brute Force Solution:**
- Try all possible combinations of edges to form a spanning tree
- Calculate cost for each valid spanning tree
- Simple but computationally expensive approach
- Not suitable for large graphs

**Algorithm:**
1. Generate all possible combinations of n-1 edges
2. Check if each combination forms a valid spanning tree
3. Calculate total cost for each valid spanning tree
4. Return the minimum cost among all valid spanning trees

**Visual Example:**
```
Brute force: Try all possible spanning trees
For graph: (1,2,1), (2,3,2), (3,4,3), (1,4,4)

All possible spanning trees:
- Tree 1: (1,2,1) + (2,3,2) + (3,4,3) ‚Üí Cost: 1+2+3 = 6
- Tree 2: (1,2,1) + (2,3,2) + (1,4,4) ‚Üí Cost: 1+2+4 = 7
- Tree 3: (1,2,1) + (3,4,3) + (1,4,4) ‚Üí Cost: 1+3+4 = 8
- Tree 4: (2,3,2) + (3,4,3) + (1,4,4) ‚Üí Cost: 2+3+4 = 9

Minimum cost: 6
```

**Implementation:**
```python
def road_construction_iii_brute_force(n, m, roads):
    from itertools import combinations
    
    # Generate all possible combinations of n-1 edges
    all_combinations = combinations(roads, n - 1)
    
    min_cost = float('inf')
    
    for edge_set in all_combinations:
        # Check if this set of edges forms a valid spanning tree
        if is_valid_spanning_tree(n, edge_set):
            total_cost = sum(cost for _, _, cost in edge_set)
            min_cost = min(min_cost, total_cost)
    
    return min_cost if min_cost != float('inf') else "IMPOSSIBLE"

def is_valid_spanning_tree(n, edges):
    # Check if edges form a connected graph with n-1 edges
    if len(edges) != n - 1:
        return False
    
    # Build adjacency list
    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for a, b, _ in edges:
        adj[a].append(b)
        adj[b].append(a)
    
    # Check connectivity using DFS
    visited = [False] * (n + 1)
    stack = [1]
    visited[1] = True
    count = 1
    
    while stack:
        node = stack.pop()
        for neighbor in adj[node]:
            if not visited[neighbor]:
                visited[neighbor] = True
                stack.append(neighbor)
                count += 1
    
    return count == n
```

**Time Complexity:** O(C(m, n-1) √ó (n + m)) for checking all combinations
**Space Complexity:** O(n + m) for adjacency list

**Why it's inefficient:**
- Exponential time complexity O(C(m, n-1))
- Not suitable for large graphs
- Overkill for this specific problem
- Impractical for competitive programming

### Approach 2: Kruskal's Algorithm (Better)

**Key Insights from Kruskal's Solution:**
- Use greedy approach to select edges in order of increasing weight
- Use Union-Find to detect cycles and maintain connectivity
- Much more efficient than brute force approach
- Standard method for MST problems

**Algorithm:**
1. Sort all edges by weight in non-decreasing order
2. Initialize Union-Find data structure
3. Process edges in order, adding edges that don't create cycles
4. Stop when we have n-1 edges (spanning tree complete)

**Visual Example:**
```
Kruskal's algorithm for graph: (1,2,1), (2,3,2), (3,4,3), (1,4,4)

Step 1: Sort edges by weight
Edges: [(1,2,1), (2,3,2), (3,4,3), (1,4,4)]

Step 2: Process edges in order

Edge (1,2,1): Add to MST
- Components: {1,2}, {3}, {4}
- MST edges: [(1,2,1)]
- Total cost: 1

Edge (2,3,2): Add to MST
- Components: {1,2,3}, {4}
- MST edges: [(1,2,1), (2,3,2)]
- Total cost: 1 + 2 = 3

Edge (3,4,3): Add to MST
- Components: {1,2,3,4}
- MST edges: [(1,2,1), (2,3,2), (3,4,3)]
- Total cost: 1 + 2 + 3 = 6

Edge (1,4,4): Skip (creates cycle)
- All cities already connected
- Final MST: [(1,2,1), (2,3,2), (3,4,3)]
- Total cost: 6
```

**Implementation:**
```python
def road_construction_iii_kruskal(n, m, roads):
    # Sort roads by cost
    roads.sort(key=lambda x: x[2])
    
    # Union-Find for cycle detection
    parent = list(range(n + 1))
    
    def find(x):
        if parent[x] != x:
            parent[x] = find(parent[x])
        return parent[x]
    
    def union(x, y):
        parent[find(x)] = find(y)
    
    # Kruskal's algorithm
    total_cost = 0
    edges_used = 0
    
    for a, b, cost in roads:
        if find(a) != find(b):
            union(a, b)
            total_cost += cost
            edges_used += 1
    
    # Check if all cities are connected
    if edges_used == n - 1:
        return total_cost
    else:
        return "IMPOSSIBLE"
```

**Time Complexity:** O(m log m) for sorting + O(m Œ±(n)) for Union-Find
**Space Complexity:** O(n) for Union-Find data structure

**Why it's better:**
- Polynomial time complexity O(m log m)
- Simple and intuitive approach
- Standard method for MST problems
- Suitable for competitive programming

### Approach 3: Optimized Kruskal's Algorithm (Optimal)

**Key Insights from Optimized Kruskal's Solution:**
- Use Union-Find with path compression and union by rank
- Optimize Union-Find operations for better performance
- Most efficient approach for MST problems
- Standard method in competitive programming

**Algorithm:**
1. Sort all edges by weight in non-decreasing order
2. Initialize optimized Union-Find with path compression and union by rank
3. Process edges in order, adding edges that don't create cycles
4. Stop when we have n-1 edges (spanning tree complete)

**Visual Example:**
```
Optimized Kruskal's algorithm for graph: (1,2,1), (2,3,2), (3,4,3), (1,4,4)

Step 1: Sort edges by weight
Edges: [(1,2,1), (2,3,2), (3,4,3), (1,4,4)]

Step 2: Initialize optimized Union-Find
Parent: [1, 2, 3, 4] (each city is its own parent)
Rank: [0, 0, 0, 0]

Step 3: Process edges in order

Edge (1,2,1): Add to MST
- Find(1) = 1, Find(2) = 2
- Union(1,2): Parent[2] = 1, Rank[1] = 1
- MST edges: [(1,2,1)]
- Total cost: 1

Edge (2,3,2): Add to MST
- Find(2) = 1, Find(3) = 3
- Union(1,3): Parent[3] = 1, Rank[1] = 1
- MST edges: [(1,2,1), (2,3,2)]
- Total cost: 1 + 2 = 3

Edge (3,4,3): Add to MST
- Find(3) = 1, Find(4) = 4
- Union(1,4): Parent[4] = 1, Rank[1] = 2
- MST edges: [(1,2,1), (2,3,2), (3,4,3)]
- Total cost: 1 + 2 + 3 = 6

Edge (1,4,4): Skip (creates cycle)
- Find(1) = 1, Find(4) = 1
- Same component, skip edge
- Final MST: [(1,2,1), (2,3,2), (3,4,3)]
- Total cost: 6
```

**Implementation:**

    # Sort roads by cost
    roads.sort(key=lambda x: x[2])
    
    # Union-Find with path compression and union by rank
    parent = list(range(n + 1))
    rank = [0] * (n + 1)
    
    def find(x):
        if parent[x] != x:
            parent[x] = find(parent[x])
        return parent[x]
    
    def union(x, y):
        px, py = find(x), find(y)
        if px == py:
            return False
        
        if rank[px] < rank[py]:
            parent[px] = py
        elif rank[px] > rank[py]:
            parent[py] = px
        else:
            parent[py] = px
            rank[px] += 1
        return True
    
    # Kruskal's algorithm
    total_cost = 0
    edges_used = 0
    
    for a, b, cost in roads:
        if union(a, b):
            total_cost += cost
            edges_used += 1
    
    # Check if all cities are connected
    if edges_used == n - 1:
        return total_cost
    else:
        return "IMPOSSIBLE"

def solve_road_construction_iii():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    roads = []
    for _ in range(m):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        roads.append((a, b, c))
    
    result = road_construction_iii_optimized(n, m, roads)
    print(result)

# Main execution
if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve_road_construction_iii()
```

**Time Complexity:** O(m log m) for sorting + O(m Œ±(n)) for optimized Union-Find
**Space Complexity:** O(n) for Union-Find data structure

**Why it's optimal:**
- O(m log m) time complexity is optimal for MST problems
- Uses optimized Union-Find with path compression and union by rank
- Most efficient approach for competitive programming
- Standard method for MST problems
