## Problem Description

Given a directed acyclic graph (DAG) with n nodes and m edges, where each node has a coin value, find the maximum number of coins that can be collected by traversing the graph.

**Input**: 
- First line: Two integers n and m (number of nodes and edges)
- Next n lines: Integer c·µ¢ (coin value at node i)
- Next m lines: Two integers a and b (edge from node a to node b)

**Output**: 
- Maximum number of coins that can be collected

**Constraints**:
- 1 ‚â§ n ‚â§ 10‚Åµ
- 1 ‚â§ m ‚â§ 2‚ãÖ10‚Åµ
- 1 ‚â§ c·µ¢ ‚â§ 10‚Åπ
- 1 ‚â§ a, b ‚â§ n
- Graph is directed and acyclic
- No self-loops or multiple edges between same pair of nodes
- Edges are unidirectional
- Nodes are numbered 1, 2, ..., n
- Find maximum coins by traversing the graph
- Each node can be visited at most once
- Must follow directed edges
- Goal is to maximize total coin collection

**Example**:
```
Input:
4 4
1 2 3 4
1 2
2 3
3 4
1 4

Output:
10
```

**Explanation**: 
- Path 1 ‚Üí 2 ‚Üí 3 ‚Üí 4: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10
- Path 1 ‚Üí 4: 1 + 4 = 5
- Maximum coins: 10 (longest path)

## Visual Example

### Input Graph
```
Nodes: 1, 2, 3, 4
Coin values: [1, 2, 3, 4]
Edges: (1‚Üí2), (2‚Üí3), (3‚Üí4), (1‚Üí4)

Graph representation:
1(1) ‚îÄ‚îÄ> 2(2) ‚îÄ‚îÄ> 3(3) ‚îÄ‚îÄ> 4(4)
‚îÇ                              ‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò
```

### Dynamic Programming Process
```
Step 1: Topological sort
- Order: 1, 2, 3, 4

Step 2: Initialize DP
- dp[i] = maximum coins collectible ending at node i
- dp[1] = 1 (coin at node 1)

Step 3: Fill DP table
- Node 1: dp[1] = 1
- Node 2: dp[2] = max(dp[1] + 2, 2) = max(1 + 2, 2) = 3
- Node 3: dp[3] = max(dp[2] + 3, 3) = max(3 + 3, 3) = 6
- Node 4: dp[4] = max(dp[3] + 4, dp[1] + 4, 4) = max(6 + 4, 1 + 4, 4) = 10

Step 4: Find maximum
- Maximum coins: max(dp[1], dp[2], dp[3], dp[4]) = 10
```

### Path Analysis
```
Optimal path: 1 ‚Üí 2 ‚Üí 3 ‚Üí 4
Coin collection:
- Node 1: 1 coin
- Node 2: 2 coins
- Node 3: 3 coins
- Node 4: 4 coins
- Total: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 coins

Alternative paths:
- 1 ‚Üí 4: 1 + 4 = 5 coins
- 1 ‚Üí 2 ‚Üí 3: 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 coins
```

### Key Insight
Dynamic programming with topological sort works by:
1. Processing nodes in topological order
2. For each node, considering all incoming paths
3. Taking maximum coins from all possible paths
4. Time complexity: O(n + m) for DAG traversal
5. Space complexity: O(n) for DP array

## üîç Solution Analysis: From Brute Force to Optimal

### Approach 1: Brute Force Path Enumeration (Inefficient)

**Key Insights from Brute Force Solution:**
- Try all possible paths in the DAG to find maximum coin collection
- Simple but computationally expensive approach
- Not suitable for large graphs
- Straightforward implementation but poor performance

**Algorithm:**
1. Generate all possible paths from each node
2. For each path, calculate the total coin collection
3. Return the maximum coin collection found
4. Handle cases where no path exists

**Visual Example:**
```
Brute force: Try all possible paths
For DAG: 1‚Üí2‚Üí3‚Üí4, 1‚Üí4
- Path 1: [1] ‚Üí 1 coin
- Path 2: [1,2] ‚Üí 1+2 = 3 coins
- Path 3: [1,2,3] ‚Üí 1+2+3 = 6 coins
- Path 4: [1,2,3,4] ‚Üí 1+2+3+4 = 10 coins
- Path 5: [1,4] ‚Üí 1+4 = 5 coins
- Try all possible paths
```

**Implementation:**
```python
def coin_collector_brute_force(n, m, coins, edges):
    # Build adjacency list
    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for a, b in edges:
        adj[a].append(b)
    
    def find_all_paths(start, current_path, visited):
        paths = []
        current_path.append(start)
        visited.add(start)
        
        # If no outgoing edges, this is a complete path
        if not adj[start]:
            paths.append(current_path[:])
        else:
            for neighbor in adj[start]:
                if neighbor not in visited:
                    paths.extend(find_all_paths(neighbor, current_path[:], visited.copy()))
        
        return paths
    
    max_coins = 0
    
    # Try all possible starting nodes
    for start in range(1, n + 1):
        paths = find_all_paths(start, [], set())
        for path in paths:
            total_coins = sum(coins[node] for node in path)
            max_coins = max(max_coins, total_coins)
    
    return max_coins

def solve_coin_collector_brute_force():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    coins = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    edges = []
    for _ in range(m):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        edges.append((a, b))
    
    result = coin_collector_brute_force(n, m, coins, edges)
    print(result)
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n! √ó n) for n nodes with exponential path enumeration
**Space Complexity:** O(n) for storing paths

**Why it's inefficient:**
- O(n!) time complexity is too slow for large graphs
- Not suitable for competitive programming with n up to 10^5
- Inefficient for large inputs
- Poor performance with many nodes

### Approach 2: Basic Dynamic Programming with Topological Sort (Better)

**Key Insights from Basic DP Solution:**
- Use dynamic programming with topological sorting
- Much more efficient than brute force approach
- Standard method for DAG path problems
- Can handle larger graphs than brute force

**Algorithm:**
1. Perform topological sort on the DAG
2. Use dynamic programming to find maximum path sum
3. For each node, consider all incoming paths
4. Return the maximum coin collection

**Visual Example:**
```
Basic DP for DAG: 1‚Üí2‚Üí3‚Üí4, 1‚Üí4
- Topological order: [1, 2, 3, 4]
- DP: dp[1] = 1, dp[2] = 3, dp[3] = 6, dp[4] = 10
- Maximum: 10 coins
```

**Implementation:**
```python
def coin_collector_basic_dp(n, m, coins, edges):
    # Build adjacency list and in-degree
    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    in_degree = [0] * (n + 1)
    
    for a, b in edges:
        adj[a].append(b)
        in_degree[b] += 1
    
    # Topological sort using Kahn's algorithm
    queue = []
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if in_degree[i] == 0:
            queue.append(i)
    
    # Dynamic programming: dp[i] = max coins collectible ending at node i
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    
    while queue:
        node = queue.pop(0)
        dp[node] = coins[node]  # Base case: collect coins at current node
        
        for neighbor in adj[node]:
            # Update dp[neighbor] with maximum value
            dp[neighbor] = max(dp[neighbor], dp[node] + coins[neighbor])
            in_degree[neighbor] -= 1
            if in_degree[neighbor] == 0:
                queue.append(neighbor)
    
    return max(dp)

def solve_coin_collector_basic():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    coins = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    edges = []
    for _ in range(m):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        edges.append((a, b))
    
    result = coin_collector_basic_dp(n, m, coins, edges)
    print(result)
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n + m) for n nodes and m edges with topological sort and DP
**Space Complexity:** O(n + m) for graph representation and DP array

**Why it's better:**
- O(n + m) time complexity is much better than O(n! √ó n)
- Standard method for DAG path problems
- Suitable for competitive programming
- Efficient for most practical cases

### Approach 3: Optimized Dynamic Programming with Efficient Topological Sort (Optimal)

**Key Insights from Optimized DP Solution:**
- Use optimized topological sorting with efficient data structures
- Most efficient approach for DAG path problems
- Standard method in competitive programming
- Can handle the maximum constraint efficiently

**Algorithm:**
1. Use optimized adjacency list representation
2. Perform topological sort with efficient queue operations
3. Use optimized dynamic programming with better data structures
4. Return the maximum coin collection efficiently

**Visual Example:**
```
Optimized DP for DAG: 1‚Üí2‚Üí3‚Üí4, 1‚Üí4
- Optimized topological order: [1, 2, 3, 4]
- Optimized DP: dp[1] = 1, dp[2] = 3, dp[3] = 6, dp[4] = 10
- Maximum: 10 coins
```

**Implementation:**
```python
def coin_collector_optimized_dp(n, m, coins, edges):
    # Build adjacency list and in-degree
    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    in_degree = [0] * (n + 1)
    
    for a, b in edges:
        adj[a].append(b)
        in_degree[b] += 1
    
    # Topological sort using Kahn's algorithm with deque
    from collections import deque
    queue = deque()
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if in_degree[i] == 0:
            queue.append(i)
    
    # Dynamic programming with optimized structure
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    
    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        dp[node] = coins[node]
        
        for neighbor in adj[node]:
            dp[neighbor] = max(dp[neighbor], dp[node] + coins[neighbor])
            in_degree[neighbor] -= 1
            if in_degree[neighbor] == 0:
                queue.append(neighbor)
    
    return max(dp)

def solve_coin_collector():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    coins = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    edges = []
    for _ in range(m):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        edges.append((a, b))
    
    result = coin_collector_optimized_dp(n, m, coins, edges)
    print(result)

# Main execution
if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve_coin_collector()
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n + m) for n nodes and m edges with optimized topological sort and DP
**Space Complexity:** O(n + m) for graph representation and DP array

**Why it's optimal:**
- O(n + m) time complexity is optimal for DAG path problems
- Uses optimized topological sorting with efficient data structures
- Most efficient approach for competitive programming
- Standard method for DAG path optimization
