# Message Route - Shortest Path Finding

## 📋 Problem Information

### 🎯 **Learning Objectives**
By the end of this problem, you should be able to:
- Understand shortest path problems and path reconstruction concepts
- Apply BFS to find shortest paths in unweighted graphs with path tracking
- Implement efficient shortest path algorithms with proper path reconstruction
- Optimize shortest path solutions using parent tracking and path enumeration
- Handle edge cases in shortest path problems (no path exists, single node, disconnected graphs)
