## Problem Description

**Problem**: There are n computers numbered 1,2,‚Ä¶,n. The computers are connected through m cables. Your task is to find a route from computer 1 to computer n.

This is a classic shortest path problem in an unweighted, undirected graph. The goal is to find the minimum number of computers to traverse to get from computer 1 to computer n, and output the actual path.

**Input**: 
- First line: Two integers n and m (number of computers and cables)
- Next m lines: Two integers a and b (cable between computers a and b)

**Output**: 
- First line: Number of computers on the route
- Second line: The route (sequence of computers)

**Constraints**:
- 2 ‚â§ n ‚â§ 10‚Åµ
- 1 ‚â§ m ‚â§ 2‚ãÖ10‚Åµ
- Graph is undirected
- No self-loops or multiple edges between same pair of computers
- Cables are bidirectional
- Computers are numbered 1, 2, ..., n

**Example**:
```
Input:
5 5
1 2
1 3
1 4
2 3
5 4

Output:
3
1 4 5
```

**Explanation**: 
- Route: 1 ‚Üí 4 ‚Üí 5
- Number of computers: 3
- This is the shortest path from computer 1 to computer 5

## Visual Example

### Input Graph
```
Computers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
Cables: (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,3), (5,4)

Graph representation:
    2 ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ 3
    ‚îÇ
    1 ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ 4 ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ 5
```

### BFS Traversal Process
```
Step 1: Initialize BFS from computer 1
Queue: [1]
Visited: {1}
Parent: {1: None}
Distance: {1: 0}

Step 2: Process computer 1
Queue: [2, 3, 4] (neighbors of 1)
Visited: {1, 2, 3, 4}
Parent: {1: None, 2: 1, 3: 1, 4: 1}
Distance: {1: 0, 2: 1, 3: 1, 4: 1}

Step 3: Process computer 2
Queue: [3, 4] (2's neighbor 3 already visited)
Visited: {1, 2, 3, 4}
Parent: {1: None, 2: 1, 3: 1, 4: 1}
Distance: {1: 0, 2: 1, 3: 1, 4: 1}

Step 4: Process computer 3
Queue: [4] (3's neighbors 1,2 already visited)
Visited: {1, 2, 3, 4}

Step 5: Process computer 4
Queue: [5] (4's neighbor 5)
Visited: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
Parent: {1: None, 2: 1, 3: 1, 4: 1, 5: 4}
Distance: {1: 0, 2: 1, 3: 1, 4: 1, 5: 2}

Step 6: Process computer 5
Queue: [] (5 is the target)
Target reached!
```

### Path Reconstruction
```
From computer 5, trace back using parent array:
- 5 ‚Üí parent[5] = 4
- 4 ‚Üí parent[4] = 1
- 1 ‚Üí parent[1] = None (source)

Reversed path: 5 ‚Üí 4 ‚Üí 1
Final path: 1 ‚Üí 4 ‚Üí 5
Distance: 2 (number of edges)
Computers visited: 3 (including start and end)
```

### Alternative Paths
```
Other possible paths from 1 to 5:
- 1 ‚Üí 2 ‚Üí 3 ‚Üí (no connection to 5) ‚úó
- 1 ‚Üí 3 ‚Üí 2 ‚Üí (no connection to 5) ‚úó
- 1 ‚Üí 4 ‚Üí 5 ‚úì (shortest path)

Shortest path: 1 ‚Üí 4 ‚Üí 5 (length = 2)
```

### Key Insight
BFS guarantees finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph because:
1. It explores nodes level by level
2. First time we reach a node, we've found the shortest path to it
3. Parent array allows us to reconstruct the actual path
4. Time complexity: O(V + E) where V = vertices, E = edges

## üîç Solution Analysis: From Brute Force to Optimal

### Approach 1: Brute Force Path Enumeration (Inefficient)

**Key Insights from Brute Force Solution:**
- Try all possible paths from source to destination
- Simple but computationally expensive approach
- Not suitable for large graphs
- Straightforward implementation but poor performance

**Algorithm:**
1. Generate all possible paths from computer 1 to computer n
2. For each path, check if it's valid (all edges exist)
3. Return the shortest valid path found
4. Handle cases where no path exists

**Visual Example:**
```
Brute force: Try all possible paths
For graph: 1-2-3, 1-4-5
- Path 1: [1, 2, 3] - Check if 3 connects to 5 ‚úó
- Path 2: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] - Check if 3 connects to 4 ‚úó
- Path 3: [1, 3, 2, 4, 5] - Check if 2 connects to 4 ‚úó
- Path 4: [1, 4, 5] ‚úì (valid path)
- Path 5: [1, 3, 4, 5] - Check if 3 connects to 4 ‚úó

Shortest valid path: [1, 4, 5]
```

**Implementation:**
```python
def message_route_brute_force(n, m, cables):
    from itertools import permutations
    
    # Build adjacency list
    graph = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for a, b in cables:
        graph[a].append(b)
        graph[b].append(a)
    
    def is_valid_path(path):
        for i in range(len(path) - 1):
            if path[i + 1] not in graph[path[i]]:
                return False
        return True
    
    # Try all possible paths of increasing length
    for length in range(2, n + 1):
        for path in permutations(range(1, n + 1), length):
            if path[0] == 1 and path[-1] == n and is_valid_path(path):
                return f"{len(path)}\n{' '.join(map(str, path))}"
    
    return "IMPOSSIBLE"

def solve_message_route_brute_force():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    cables = []
    for _ in range(m):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        cables.append((a, b))
    
    result = message_route_brute_force(n, m, cables)
    print(result)
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n! √ó n) for n computers with exponential path enumeration
**Space Complexity:** O(n) for storing path

**Why it's inefficient:**
- O(n!) time complexity is too slow for large n values
- Not suitable for competitive programming with n up to 10^5
- Inefficient for large inputs
- Poor performance with many computers

### Approach 2: Basic BFS with Path Tracking (Better)

**Key Insights from Basic BFS Solution:**
- Use BFS to find shortest path with path tracking
- Much more efficient than brute force approach
- Standard method for unweighted shortest path
- Can handle larger graphs than brute force

**Algorithm:**
1. Use BFS to traverse the graph level by level
2. Track the path while exploring
3. Return the first path found to destination
4. Handle cases where no path exists

**Visual Example:**
```
Basic BFS for graph: 1-2-3, 1-4-5
- Queue: [(1, [1])]
- Process 1: Queue: [(2, [1,2]), (3, [1,3]), (4, [1,4])]
- Process 2: Queue: [(3, [1,3]), (4, [1,4])]
- Process 3: Queue: [(4, [1,4])]
- Process 4: Queue: [(5, [1,4,5])]
- Process 5: Found target! Path: [1,4,5]
```

**Implementation:**
```python
def message_route_basic_bfs(n, m, cables):
    from collections import deque
    
    # Build adjacency list
    graph = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for a, b in cables:
        graph[a].append(b)
        graph[b].append(a)
    
    def bfs():
        queue = deque([(1, [1])])  # (node, path)
        visited = [False] * (n + 1)
        visited[1] = True
        
        while queue:
            node, path = queue.popleft()
            
            if node == n:
                return path
            
            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                if not visited[neighbor]:
                    visited[neighbor] = True
                    new_path = path + [neighbor]
                    queue.append((neighbor, new_path))
        
        return None  # No path found
    
    path = bfs()
    if path is None:
        return "IMPOSSIBLE"
    else:
        return f"{len(path)}\n{' '.join(map(str, path))}"

def solve_message_route_basic_bfs():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    cables = []
    for _ in range(m):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        cables.append((a, b))
    
    result = message_route_basic_bfs(n, m, cables)
    print(result)
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n + m) for n computers and m cables with BFS traversal
**Space Complexity:** O(n + m) for graph representation and queue

**Why it's better:**
- O(n + m) time complexity is much better than O(n! √ó n)
- Standard method for unweighted shortest path
- Suitable for competitive programming
- Efficient for most practical cases

### Approach 3: Optimized BFS with Parent Tracking (Optimal)

**Key Insights from Optimized BFS Solution:**
- Use BFS with parent tracking for efficient path reconstruction
- Most efficient approach for shortest path problems
- Standard method in competitive programming
- Can handle the maximum constraint efficiently

**Algorithm:**
1. Use BFS with parent tracking to find shortest path
2. Reconstruct path efficiently using parent array
3. Use optimized data structures for better performance
4. Return the shortest path efficiently

**Visual Example:**
```
Optimized BFS for graph: 1-2-3, 1-4-5
- Initialize: parent = [None, None, None, None, None, None]
- BFS: parent = [None, None, 1, 1, 1, 4]
- Path reconstruction: 5 ‚Üí 4 ‚Üí 1
- Final path: [1, 4, 5]
```

**Implementation:**
```python
def message_route_optimized_bfs(n, m, cables):
    from collections import deque
    
    # Build adjacency list
    graph = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for a, b in cables:
        graph[a].append(b)
        graph[b].append(a)
    
    def bfs():
        queue = deque([1])
        visited = [False] * (n + 1)
        parent = [None] * (n + 1)
        visited[1] = True
        
        while queue:
            node = queue.popleft()
            
            if node == n:
                # Reconstruct path
                path = []
                current = n
                while current is not None:
                    path.append(current)
                    current = parent[current]
                return path[::-1]  # Reverse to get correct order
            
            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                if not visited[neighbor]:
                    visited[neighbor] = True
                    parent[neighbor] = node
                    queue.append(neighbor)
        
        return None  # No path found
    
    path = bfs()
    if path is None:
        return "IMPOSSIBLE"
    else:
        return f"{len(path)}\n{' '.join(map(str, path))}"

def solve_message_route():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    cables = []
    for _ in range(m):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        cables.append((a, b))
    
    result = message_route_optimized_bfs(n, m, cables)
    print(result)

# Main execution
if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve_message_route()
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n + m) for n computers and m cables with optimized BFS
**Space Complexity:** O(n + m) for graph representation and parent array

**Why it's optimal:**
- O(n + m) time complexity is optimal for unweighted shortest path
- Uses optimized BFS with efficient parent tracking
- Most efficient approach for competitive programming
- Standard method for shortest path problems
