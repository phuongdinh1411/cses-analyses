## 🔍 Solution Analysis: From Brute Force to Optimal

### Approach 1: Brute Force Solution

**Key Insights from Brute Force Solution**:
- **Complete Enumeration**: Try all possible edge combinations
- **Simple Implementation**: Easy to understand and implement
- **Direct Calculation**: Use basic graph connectivity
- **Inefficient**: O(2^m) time complexity

**Key Insight**: Try all possible combinations of edges to remove.

**Algorithm**:
- Generate all possible subsets of edges
- For each subset, check if removing those edges disconnects source from sink
- Return minimum size of such subset

**Visual Example**:
```
Graph: 0->1->3, 0->2->3, 1->2

Edge removal combinations:
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Remove {}: 0 can reach 3 (NO)      │
│ Remove {(0,1)}: 0 can reach 3 (NO) │
│ Remove {(0,2)}: 0 can reach 3 (NO) │
│ Remove {(0,1),(0,2)}: 0 cannot reach 3 (YES) │
│                                   │
│ Minimum: 2 edges                  │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Implementation**:
```python
def brute_force_police_chase(n, source, sink, edges):
    """Find minimum cut using brute force approach"""
    from itertools import combinations
    
    min_edges = float('inf')
    
    # Try all possible combinations of edges to remove
    for r in range(len(edges) + 1):
        for edge_subset in combinations(edges, r):
            # Check if removing these edges disconnects source from sink
            if is_disconnected(n, source, sink, edges, edge_subset):
                min_edges = min(min_edges, len(edge_subset))
    
    return min_edges

def is_disconnected(n, source, sink, edges, removed_edges):
    """Check if source is disconnected from sink after removing edges"""
    # Build adjacency list excluding removed edges
    adj = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    removed_set = set(removed_edges)
    
    for u, v in edges:
        if (u, v) not in removed_set:
            adj[u].append(v)
    
    # BFS to check connectivity
    visited = [False] * n
    queue = [source]
    visited[source] = True
    
    while queue:
        vertex = queue.pop(0)
        if vertex == sink:
            return False  # Still connected
        
        for neighbor in adj[vertex]:
            if not visited[neighbor]:
                visited[neighbor] = True
                queue.append(neighbor)
    
    return True  # Disconnected

# Example usage
n = 4
source = 0
sink = 3
edges = [(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3)]
result = brute_force_police_chase(n, source, sink, edges)
print(f"Brute force minimum cut: {result}")
```

**Time Complexity**: O(2^m)
**Space Complexity**: O(n + m)

**Why it's inefficient**: O(2^m) time complexity for checking all combinations.

│                                   │
│ Max flow: 2                        │
