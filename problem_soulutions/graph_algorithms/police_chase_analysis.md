# Police Chase - Minimum Cut Problem

## 📋 Problem Description

Given a network with n computers and m connections, find the minimum number of connections that need to be cut to disconnect computer 1 from computer n.

This is a minimum cut problem where we need to find the minimum number of edges to remove to disconnect the source from the sink. We can solve this using maximum flow algorithms like Ford-Fulkerson or Dinic's algorithm.

**Input**: 
- First line: Two integers n and m (number of computers and connections)
- Next m lines: Two integers a and b (connection between computers a and b)

**Output**: 
- Minimum number of connections that need to be cut

**Constraints**:
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 500
- 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000
- 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n

**Example**:
```
Input:
4 5
1 2
2 3
3 4
1 3
2 4

Output:
2
```

**Explanation**: 
- Network: 1-2-3-4, 1-3, 2-4
- To disconnect 1 from 4, we need to cut at least 2 connections
- One possible cut: remove edges (1,2) and (3,4)
- This disconnects computer 1 from computer 4

## 🎯 Solution Progression

### Step 1: Understanding the Problem
- **Goal**: Find minimum number of edges to cut to disconnect source from sink
- **Key Insight**: Use maximum flow algorithms to find minimum cut
- **Challenge**: Efficiently find maximum flow and identify cut edges

### Step 2: Initial Approach
**Minimum cut using maximum flow (Menger's theorem):**

```python
def police_chase_naive(n, m, connections):
    # Build adjacency list with capacities
    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    capacity = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    
    for a, b in connections:
        adj[a].append(b)
        adj[b].append(a)
        capacity[a][b] = 1
        capacity[b][a] = 1  # Undirected graph
    
    def bfs(source, sink):
        # Find augmenting path using BFS
        parent = [-1] * (n + 1)
        parent[source] = source
        queue = [source]
        
        while queue:
            current = queue.pop(0)
            
            for next_node in adj[current]:
                if parent[next_node] == -1 and capacity[current][next_node] > 0:
                    parent[next_node] = current
                    queue.append(next_node)
                    
                    if next_node == sink:
                        break
        
        if parent[sink] == -1:
            return 0  # No augmenting path found
        
        # Find bottleneck capacity
        bottleneck = float('inf')
        current = sink
        while current != source:
            bottleneck = min(bottleneck, capacity[parent[current]][current])
            current = parent[current]
        
        # Update residual graph
        current = sink
        while current != source:
            capacity[parent[current]][current] -= bottleneck
            capacity[current][parent[current]] += bottleneck
            current = parent[current]
        
        return bottleneck
    
    # Ford-Fulkerson algorithm
    max_flow = 0
    while True:
        flow = bfs(1, n)
        if flow == 0:
            break
        max_flow += flow
    
    return max_flow
```

**Why this is inefficient**: The implementation is correct but can be optimized for clarity.

### Improvement 1: Optimized Minimum Cut Algorithm - O(n * m * max_flow)
**Description**: Use optimized Ford-Fulkerson algorithm for minimum cut.

```python
def police_chase_optimized(n, m, connections):
    from collections import deque
    
    # Build adjacency list with capacities
    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    capacity = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    
    for a, b in connections:
        adj[a].append(b)
        adj[b].append(a)
        capacity[a][b] = 1
        capacity[b][a] = 1
    
    def bfs(source, sink):
        parent = [-1] * (n + 1)
        parent[source] = source
        queue = deque([source])
        
        while queue:
            current = queue.popleft()
            
            for next_node in adj[current]:
                if parent[next_node] == -1 and capacity[current][next_node] > 0:
                    parent[next_node] = current
                    queue.append(next_node)
                    
                    if next_node == sink:
                        break
        
        if parent[sink] == -1:
            return 0
        
        # Find bottleneck and update residual graph
        bottleneck = float('inf')
        current = sink
        while current != source:
            bottleneck = min(bottleneck, capacity[parent[current]][current])
            current = parent[current]
        
        current = sink
        while current != source:
            capacity[parent[current]][current] -= bottleneck
            capacity[current][parent[current]] += bottleneck
            current = parent[current]
        
        return bottleneck
    
    # Ford-Fulkerson algorithm
    max_flow = 0
    while True:
        flow = bfs(1, n)
        if flow == 0:
            break
        max_flow += flow
    
    return max_flow
```

**Why this improvement works**: We use optimized Ford-Fulkerson algorithm to find minimum cut efficiently.

### Step 3: Optimization/Alternative
**Dinic's algorithm for more efficient maximum flow:**

### Step 4: Complete Solution

```python
from collections import deque

n, m = map(int, input().split())
connections = []
for _ in range(m):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    connections.append((a, b))

def find_minimum_cut(n, m, connections):
    # Build adjacency list with capacities
    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    capacity = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    
    for a, b in connections:
        adj[a].append(b)
        adj[b].append(a)
        capacity[a][b] = 1
        capacity[b][a] = 1  # Undirected graph
    
    def bfs(source, sink):
        # Find augmenting path using BFS
        parent = [-1] * (n + 1)
        parent[source] = source
        queue = deque([source])
        
        while queue:
            current = queue.popleft()
            
            for next_node in adj[current]:
                if parent[next_node] == -1 and capacity[current][next_node] > 0:
                    parent[next_node] = current
                    queue.append(next_node)
                    
                    if next_node == sink:
                        break
        
        if parent[sink] == -1:
            return 0  # No augmenting path found
        
        # Find bottleneck capacity
        bottleneck = float('inf')
        current = sink
        while current != source:
            bottleneck = min(bottleneck, capacity[parent[current]][current])
            current = parent[current]
        
        # Update residual graph
        current = sink
        while current != source:
            capacity[parent[current]][current] -= bottleneck
            capacity[current][parent[current]] += bottleneck
            current = parent[current]
        
        return bottleneck
    
    # Ford-Fulkerson algorithm
    max_flow = 0
    while True:
        flow = bfs(1, n)
        if flow == 0:
            break
        max_flow += flow
    
    return max_flow

result = find_minimum_cut(n, m, connections)
print(result)
```

### Step 5: Testing Our Solution
**Test cases to verify correctness:**
- **Test 1**: Simple network with single path (should return 1)
- **Test 2**: Network with multiple paths (should return minimum cut)
- **Test 3**: Network with no path (should return 0)
- **Test 4**: Complex network (should return correct minimum cut)

## 🎨 Visual Example

### Input Example
```
4 computers, 5 connections:
Connection 1-2
Connection 2-3
Connection 3-4
Connection 1-3
Connection 2-4
```

### Network Visualization
```
Computer network:
1 ──── 2 ──── 3 ──── 4
│      │      │      │
│      │      │      │
└──────┼──────┘      │
       └──────────────┘

All connections:
- 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 1-3, 2-4
```

### Maximum Flow Process
```
Convert to flow network (all edges have capacity 1):

Step 1: Find augmenting path 1→2→3→4
- Flow: 1 unit along path 1→2→3→4
- Residual capacities: 1-2: 0, 2-3: 0, 3-4: 0

Step 2: Find augmenting path 1→3→4
- Flow: 1 unit along path 1→3→4
- Residual capacities: 1-3: 0, 3-4: 0

Step 3: No more augmenting paths
- Maximum flow: 2
- Minimum cut: 2 edges
```

### Minimum Cut Analysis
```
To disconnect computer 1 from computer 4:

Option 1: Cut edges (1,2) and (3,4)
- Removes: 1-2, 3-4
- Result: 1 isolated, 4 isolated
- Cut size: 2

Option 2: Cut edges (1,3) and (2,4)
- Removes: 1-3, 2-4
- Result: 1 isolated, 4 isolated
- Cut size: 2

Minimum cut: 2 edges
```

### Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm
```
Using BFS to find augmenting paths:

Step 1: BFS from 1 to 4
- Path: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4
- Send 1 unit of flow
- Update residual graph

Step 2: BFS from 1 to 4
- Path: 1 → 3 → 4
- Send 1 unit of flow
- Update residual graph

Step 3: BFS from 1 to 4
- No path found
- Maximum flow: 2
```
