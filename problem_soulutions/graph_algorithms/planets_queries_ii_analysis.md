## 📋 Problem Description

Given a directed graph with n planets and q queries, for each query find the first planet that appears in both paths starting from planets a and b.

This is a path intersection problem where we need to find the first common planet in the paths from two different starting planets. We can solve this efficiently using binary lifting or by finding the lowest common ancestor in the functional graph.

**Input**: 
- First line: Two integers n and q (number of planets and queries)
- Second line: n integers t₁, t₂, ..., tₙ (teleporter destinations)
- Next q lines: Two integers a and b (find first common planet in paths from a and b)

**Output**: 
- For each query, print the first common planet, or -1 if no common planet exists

**Constraints**:
- 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 2⋅10⁵
- 1 ≤ tᵢ ≤ n
- 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n

**Example**:
```
Input:
5 3
2 3 4 5 3
1 2
1 3
2 4

Output:
3
3
-1
```

**Explanation**: 
- Query 1: Path from 1: 1→2→3→4→5→3, Path from 2: 2→3→4→5→3, First common: 3
- Query 2: Path from 1: 1→2→3→4→5→3, Path from 3: 3→4→5→3, First common: 3
- Query 3: Path from 2: 2→3→4→5→3, Path from 4: 4→5→3, No common planet

## 🎯 Visual Example

### Input Graph and Queries
```
Planets: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
Teleporters: [2, 3, 4, 5, 3]
Queries: (1,2), (1,3), (2,4)

Graph representation:
1 ──> 2 ──> 3 ──> 4 ──> 5
      │              │
      └──────────────┘
```

### Path Analysis
```
Step 1: Build paths from each planet
- Path from 1: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 3 → ...
- Path from 2: 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 3 → ...
- Path from 3: 3 → 4 → 5 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 3 → ...
- Path from 4: 4 → 5 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 3 → ...
- Path from 5: 5 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 3 → ...

Step 2: Process queries

Query 1: (1,2)
- Path from 1: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 3, 4, 5, 3, ...]
- Path from 2: [2, 3, 4, 5, 3, 4, 5, 3, ...]
- First common planet: 3 (at position 2 in path 1, position 1 in path 2)

Query 2: (1,3)
- Path from 1: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 3, 4, 5, 3, ...]
- Path from 3: [3, 4, 5, 3, 4, 5, 3, ...]
- First common planet: 3 (at position 2 in path 1, position 0 in path 3)

Query 3: (2,4)
- Path from 2: [2, 3, 4, 5, 3, 4, 5, 3, ...]
- Path from 4: [4, 5, 3, 4, 5, 3, ...]
- No common planet in initial segments
```

### Key Insight
Path intersection algorithm works by:
1. Building paths from each starting planet
2. Finding the first common planet in both paths
3. Using binary lifting for efficient path traversal
4. Time complexity: O(q × log n) for queries
5. Space complexity: O(n × log n) for binary lifting table

## 🎯 Solution Progression

### Step 1: Understanding the Problem
- **Goal**: Find first common planet in paths from two starting planets
- **Key Insight**: Use binary lifting or path intersection techniques
- **Challenge**: Handle large queries efficiently without generating full paths

### Step 2: Initial Approach
**Naive path comparison by generating full paths:**

```python
def planets_queries_ii_naive(n, q, teleporters, queries):
    def get_path(start):
        path = []
        current = start
        visited = set()
        
        while current not in visited:
            path.append(current)
            visited.add(current)
            current = teleporters[current - 1]
        
        return path
    
    results = []
    for a, b in queries:
        path_a = get_path(a)
        path_b = get_path(b)
        
        # Find first common element
        common = -1
        for planet in path_a: if planet in 
path_b: common = planet
                break
        
        results.append(common)
    
    return results
```

**Why this is inefficient**: We generate full paths for each query, leading to quadratic complexity.

### Improvement 1: Cycle Detection with Binary Lifting - O(n log n + q log n)
**Description**: Use binary lifting to find cycle entry points and compare efficiently.

```python
def planets_queries_ii_optimized(n, q, teleporters, queries):
    # Build binary lifting table
    log_n = 20
    up = [[0] * n for _ in range(log_n)]
    
    # Initialize first row
    for i in range(n):
        up[0][i] = teleporters[i] - 1
    
    # Build binary lifting table
    for j in range(1, log_n):
        for i in range(n):
            up[j][i] = up[j-1][up[j-1][i]]
    # Find cycle entry points using Floyd's cycle finding
    def find_cycle_entry(start):
        # Floyd's cycle finding
        slow = fast = start - 1
        while True:
            slow = teleporters[slow] - 1
            fast = teleporters[teleporters[fast] - 1] - 1
            if slow == fast:
                break
        
        # Find cycle entry
        slow = start - 1
        while slow != fast:
            slow = teleporters[slow] - 1
            fast = teleporters[fast] - 1
        
        return slow + 1
    
    # Precompute cycle entries
    cycle_entries = [find_cycle_entry(i) for i in range(1, n + 1)]
    
    # Answer queries
    results = []
    for a, b in queries:
        # Check if paths meet before entering cycles
        path_a = []
        path_b = []
        
        current_a = a
        current_b = b
        
        # Generate paths until cycle entry
        while current_a != cycle_entries[a - 1]:
            path_a.append(current_a)
            current_a = teleporters[current_a - 1]
        path_a.append(current_a)
        
        while current_b != cycle_entries[b - 1]:
            path_b.append(current_b)
            current_b = teleporters[current_b - 1]
        path_b.append(current_b)
        
        # Find first common element
        common = -1
        for planet in path_a: if planet in 
path_b: common = planet
                break
        
        results.append(common)
    
    return results
```

**Why this improvement works**: We use Floyd's cycle finding to detect cycles and then compare paths efficiently.

### Step 3: Optimization/Alternative
**Enhanced cycle detection with binary lifting:**

### Step 4: Complete Solution

```python
n, q = map(int, input().split())
teleporters = list(map(int, input().split()))

def answer_planets_queries_ii(n, q, teleporters, queries):
    # Find cycle entry points using Floyd's cycle finding
    def find_cycle_entry(start):
        # Floyd's cycle finding
        slow = fast = start - 1
        while True:
            slow = teleporters[slow] - 1
            fast = teleporters[teleporters[fast] - 1] - 1
            if slow == fast:
                break
        
        # Find cycle entry
        slow = start - 1
        while slow != fast:
            slow = teleporters[slow] - 1
            fast = teleporters[fast] - 1
        
        return slow + 1
    
    # Precompute cycle entries
    cycle_entries = [find_cycle_entry(i) for i in range(1, n + 1)]
    
    # Answer queries
    results = []
    for a, b in queries:
        # Check if paths meet before entering cycles
        path_a = []
        path_b = []
        
        current_a = a
        current_b = b
        
        # Generate paths until cycle entry
        while current_a != cycle_entries[a - 1]:
            path_a.append(current_a)
            current_a = teleporters[current_a - 1]
        path_a.append(current_a)
        
        while current_b != cycle_entries[b - 1]:
            path_b.append(current_b)
            current_b = teleporters[current_b - 1]
        path_b.append(current_b)
        
        # Find first common element
        common = -1
        for planet in path_a: if planet in 
path_b: common = planet
                break
        
        results.append(common)
    
    return results

# Read queries
queries = []
for _ in range(q):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    queries.append((a, b))

result = answer_planets_queries_ii(n, q, teleporters, queries)
for res in result:
    print(res)
```

### Step 5: Testing Our Solution
**Test cases to verify correctness:**
- **Test 1**: Simple paths with common planet (should return common planet)
- **Test 2**: Paths with no common planet (should return -1)
- **Test 3**: Paths entering same cycle (should return cycle entry)
- **Test 4**: Complex functional graph (should handle cycles correctly)

## Notable Techniques

### 1. **Floyd's Cycle Finding**
```python
def floyd_cycle_finding(teleporters, start):
    slow = fast = start - 1
    
    # Find meeting point
    while True:
        slow = teleporters[slow] - 1
        fast = teleporters[teleporters[fast] - 1] - 1
        if slow == fast:
            break
    
    # Find cycle entry
    slow = start - 1
    while slow != fast:
        slow = teleporters[slow] - 1
        fast = teleporters[fast] - 1
    
    return slow + 1
```

### 2. **Path Generation**
```python
def generate_path(teleporters, start, cycle_entry):
    path = []
    current = start
    
    while current != cycle_entry:
        path.append(current)
        current = teleporters[current - 1]
    
    path.append(current)
    return path
```

### 3. **Common Element Finding**
```python
def find_common_element(path_a, path_b):
    for planet in path_a: if planet in 
path_b: return planet
    return -1
```

## Problem-Solving Framework

1. **Identify problem type**: This is a path intersection problem with cycles
2. **Choose approach**: Use Floyd's cycle finding to detect cycles
3. **Find cycle entries**: Precompute cycle entry points for all nodes
4. **Generate paths**: Create paths from start to cycle entry
5. **Find intersection**: Compare paths to find first common element
6. **Handle cycles**: Ensure paths don't enter cycles unnecessarily
7. **Return results**: Output first common planet for each query
