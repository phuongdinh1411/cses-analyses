# Flight Discount

## Problem Statement
Given a directed graph with n cities and m flights, find the minimum cost to travel from city 1 to city n. You can use at most one discount coupon that halves the cost of any flight.

### Input
The first input line has two integers n and m: the number of cities and flights.
Then there are m lines describing the flights. Each line has three integers a, b, and c: there is a flight from city a to city b with cost c.

### Output
Print one integer: the minimum cost to travel from city 1 to city n.

### Constraints
- 1 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 10^5
- 1 â‰¤ m â‰¤ 2â‹…10^5
- 1 â‰¤ a,b â‰¤ n
- 1 â‰¤ c â‰¤ 10^9

### Example
```
Input:
3 4
1 2 3
2 3 1
1 3 7
2 1 5

Output:
2
```

## Solution Progression

### Approach 1: Dijkstra with Discount State - O(m log n)
**Description**: Use Dijkstra's algorithm with a state to track discount usage.

```python
import heapq

def flight_discount_naive(n, m, edges):
    # Build adjacency list
    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for a, b, c in edges:
        adj[a].append((b, c))
    
    # Dijkstra with discount state
    pq = [(0, 1, False)]  # (cost, node, discount_used)
    dist = [[float('inf')] * 2 for _ in range(n + 1)]
    dist[1][0] = 0
    
    while pq:
        cost, node, used = heapq.heappop(pq)
        
        if node == n:
            return cost
        
        if cost > dist[node][used]:
            continue
        
        for neighbor, weight in adj[node]:
            # Without discount
            if not used and cost + weight < dist[neighbor][0]:
                dist[neighbor][0] = cost + weight
                heapq.heappush(pq, (dist[neighbor][0], neighbor, False))
            
            # With discount (if not used yet)
            if not used and cost + weight // 2 < dist[neighbor][1]:
                dist[neighbor][1] = cost + weight // 2
                heapq.heappush(pq, (dist[neighbor][1], neighbor, True))
            
            # Already used discount
            if used and cost + weight < dist[neighbor][1]:
                dist[neighbor][1] = cost + weight
                heapq.heappush(pq, (dist[neighbor][1], neighbor, True))
    
    return min(dist[n][0], dist[n][1])
```

**Why this is inefficient**: The implementation is correct but can be optimized for clarity.

### Improvement 1: Optimized Dijkstra with State - O(m log n)
**Description**: Use optimized Dijkstra with cleaner state management.

```python
import heapq

def flight_discount_optimized(n, m, edges):
    # Build adjacency list
    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for a, b, c in edges:
        adj[a].append((b, c))
    
    # Dijkstra with discount state
    pq = [(0, 1, False)]  # (cost, node, discount_used)
    dist = [[float('inf')] * 2 for _ in range(n + 1)]
    dist[1][0] = 0
    
    while pq:
        cost, node, used = heapq.heappop(pq)
        
        if node == n:
            return cost
        
        if cost > dist[node][used]:
            continue
        
        for neighbor, weight in adj[node]:
            # Try without discount
            new_cost = cost + weight
            if new_cost < dist[neighbor][used]:
                dist[neighbor][used] = new_cost
                heapq.heappush(pq, (new_cost, neighbor, used))
            
            # Try with discount (if not used yet)
            if not used:
                new_cost = cost + weight // 2
                if new_cost < dist[neighbor][1]:
                    dist[neighbor][1] = new_cost
                    heapq.heappush(pq, (new_cost, neighbor, True))
    
    return min(dist[n][0], dist[n][1])
```

**Why this improvement works**: We use Dijkstra's algorithm with a state to track whether the discount has been used. We maintain two distances for each node: one without discount and one with discount.

## Final Optimal Solution

```python
import heapq

n, m = map(int, input().split())
edges = []
for _ in range(m):
    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
    edges.append((a, b, c))

def find_minimum_cost_with_discount(n, m, edges):
    # Build adjacency list
    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for a, b, c in edges:
        adj[a].append((b, c))
    
    # Dijkstra with discount state
    pq = [(0, 1, False)]  # (cost, node, discount_used)
    dist = [[float('inf')] * 2 for _ in range(n + 1)]
    dist[1][0] = 0
    
    while pq:
        cost, node, used = heapq.heappop(pq)
        
        if node == n:
            return cost
        
        if cost > dist[node][used]:
            continue
        
        for neighbor, weight in adj[node]:
            # Try without discount
            new_cost = cost + weight
            if new_cost < dist[neighbor][used]:
                dist[neighbor][used] = new_cost
                heapq.heappush(pq, (new_cost, neighbor, used))
            
            # Try with discount (if not used yet)
            if not used:
                new_cost = cost + weight // 2
                if new_cost < dist[neighbor][1]:
                    dist[neighbor][1] = new_cost
                    heapq.heappush(pq, (new_cost, neighbor, True))
    
    return min(dist[n][0], dist[n][1])

result = find_minimum_cost_with_discount(n, m, edges)
print(result)
```

## Notable Techniques

### 1. **Dijkstra with State**
```python
def dijkstra_with_state(n, adj, start, end):
    pq = [(0, start, False)]  # (cost, node, state)
    dist = [[float('inf')] * 2 for _ in range(n + 1)]
    dist[start][0] = 0
    
    while pq:
        cost, node, state = heapq.heappop(pq)
        
        if node == end:
            return cost
        
        if cost > dist[node][state]:
            continue
        
        for neighbor, weight in adj[node]:
            # Process with current state
            new_cost = cost + weight
            if new_cost < dist[neighbor][state]:
                dist[neighbor][state] = new_cost
                heapq.heappush(pq, (new_cost, neighbor, state))
            
            # Process with state change (if applicable)
            if not state:
                new_cost = cost + weight // 2
                if new_cost < dist[neighbor][1]:
                    dist[neighbor][1] = new_cost
                    heapq.heappush(pq, (new_cost, neighbor, True))
    
    return min(dist[end][0], dist[end][1])
```

### 2. **State Tracking**
```python
def track_state(cost, node, used, dist, pq):
    if cost < dist[node][used]:
        dist[node][used] = cost
        heapq.heappush(pq, (cost, node, used))
```

### 3. **Discount Application**
```python
def apply_discount(weight, discount_used):
    if not discount_used:
        return weight // 2
    return weight
```

## Problem-Solving Framework

1. **Identify problem type**: This is a shortest path problem with a discount constraint
2. **Choose approach**: Use Dijkstra's algorithm with state tracking
3. **Define state**: Track whether discount has been used
4. **Initialize**: Set up priority queue and distance arrays
5. **Process nodes**: Handle both with and without discount cases
6. **Update distances**: Maintain separate distances for each state
7. **Return result**: Output minimum of both final states

                        heapq.heappush(pq, (discounted_cost, neighbor, new_mask))
    
    return min(dist[n])
```

#### **Variation 2: Flight Discount with Constraints**
**Problem**: Find minimum cost path with constraints on discount usage.
```python

    # constraints = {'max_discounts': x, 'min_cost': y, 'max_cost': z}
    
    # Build adjacency list

    import heapq
    
    # dist[node][discounts_used] = minimum cost to reach node with discounts_used

        # Apply cost constraints
        if 'min_cost' in constraints and cost < constraints['min_cost']:
            continue

    return min(dist[n])
```

#### **Variation 3: Flight Discount with Probabilities**
**Problem**: Each discount has a probability of working, find expected minimum cost.
```python
def probabilistic_flight_discount(n, m, edges, discount_probabilities):
    # discount_probabilities[(a, b)] = probability that discount works for edge (a, b)
    
    # Build adjacency list with probabilities

    for a, b, c in edges:
        prob = discount_probabilities.get((a, b), 0.0)
        adj[a].append((b, c, prob))
    
    import heapq
    
    # dist[node][discount_used] = (cost, probability)
    dist = [[(float('inf'), 0.0)] * 2 for _ in range(n + 1)]
    dist[1][0] = (0, 1.0)
    
    pq = [(0, 1, False, 1.0)]  # (cost, node, discount_used, probability)
    
    while pq:

        return dist[n][0]
    else:
        return dist[n][1]
```

#### **Variation 4: Flight Discount with Time Constraints**
**Problem**: Each flight has a time duration, find minimum cost path within time limit.
```python
def time_constrained_flight_discount(n, m, edges, time_limit):
    # edges = [(a, b, cost, time), ...]
    
    # Build adjacency list with times
    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for a, b, cost, time in edges:
        adj[a].append((b, cost, time))
    
    import heapq
    
    # dist[node][discount_used][time] = minimum cost to reach node with discount_used at time
    dist = [[[float('inf')] * (time_limit + 1) for _ in range(2)] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    dist[1][0][0] = 0
    
    pq = [(0, 1, False, 0)]  # (cost, node, discount_used, time)
    
    while pq:

        if node == n:
            return cost
        
        if cost > dist[node][used][time]:
            continue
        
        for neighbor, weight, flight_time in adj[node]:

            if new_time > time_limit:
                continue
            
            # Try without discount
            new_cost = cost + weight
            if new_cost < dist[neighbor][used][new_time]:
                dist[neighbor][used][new_time] = new_cost
                heapq.heappush(pq, (new_cost, neighbor, used, new_time))
            
            # Try with discount (if not used yet)
            if not used:
                discounted_cost = cost + weight // 2
                if discounted_cost < dist[neighbor][1][new_time]:

                    heapq.heappush(pq, (discounted_cost, neighbor, True, new_time))
    
    # Find minimum cost within time limit
    min_cost = float('inf')
    for used in range(2):
        for t in range(time_limit + 1):
            min_cost = min(min_cost, dist[n][used][t])
    
    return min_cost if min_cost != float('inf') else -1
```

#### **Variation 5: Flight Discount with Dynamic Updates**
**Problem**: Handle dynamic updates to flight costs and find minimum cost after each update.
```python
def dynamic_flight_discount(n, m, initial_edges, updates):
    # updates = [(edge_index, new_cost), ...]
    
    edges = initial_edges.copy()
    results = []
    
    for edge_index, new_cost in updates:

        a, b, old_cost = edges[edge_index]
        edges[edge_index] = (a, b, new_cost)
        
        # Rebuild adjacency list
        adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
        for a, b, c in edges:
            adj[a].append((b, c))
        
        # Run Dijkstra with discount
        import heapq
        
        dist = [[float('inf')] * 2 for _ in range(n + 1)]
        dist[1][0] = 0
        
        pq = [(0, 1, False)]
        
        while pq:
            cost, node, used = heapq.heappop(pq)
            
            if node == n:
                break
            
            if cost > dist[node][used]:
                continue
            
            for neighbor, weight in adj[node]:
                # Try without discount
                new_cost = cost + weight
                if new_cost < dist[neighbor][used]:
                    dist[neighbor][used] = new_cost
                    heapq.heappush(pq, (new_cost, neighbor, used))
                
                # Try with discount (if not used yet)
                if not used:
                    discounted_cost = cost + weight // 2
                    if discounted_cost < dist[neighbor][1]:
                        dist[neighbor][1] = discounted_cost
                        heapq.heappush(pq, (discounted_cost, neighbor, True))
        
        result = min(dist[n][0], dist[n][1])
        results.append(result)
