# Flight Discount - Graph Algorithm Problem

## 📋 Problem Information

### 🎯 **Learning Objectives**
By the end of this problem, you should be able to:
- Understand the concept of shortest path with edge modification in graph algorithms
- Apply efficient algorithms for finding shortest paths with one edge discount
- Implement Dijkstra's algorithm with state modification
- Optimize graph algorithms for discount and modification problems
- Handle special cases in modified shortest path problems

### 📚 **Prerequisites**
Before attempting this problem, ensure you understand:
- **Algorithm Knowledge**: Graph algorithms, shortest path, Dijkstra's algorithm, state space search
- **Data Structures**: Graphs, priority queues, distance arrays, state tracking
- **Mathematical Concepts**: Graph theory, shortest paths, state space, optimization
- **Programming Skills**: Graph operations, priority queues, state management, shortest path algorithms
- **Related Problems**: Shortest Routes I (graph_algorithms), High Score (graph_algorithms), Message Route (graph_algorithms)

## 📋 Problem Description

Given a weighted directed graph, find the shortest path from source to destination where you can use a discount on exactly one edge (reduce its weight to half).

**Input**: 
- n: number of vertices
- m: number of edges
- source: source vertex
- destination: destination vertex
- edges: array of (u, v, weight) representing directed edges

**Output**: 
- Shortest distance from source to destination with one edge discount

**Constraints**:
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
- 1 ≤ m ≤ 2×10^5
- 1 ≤ weight ≤ 10^9

**Example**:
```
Input:
n = 4, source = 0, destination = 3
edges = [(0,1,4), (0,2,1), (1,2,2), (1,3,1), (2,3,3)]

Output:
2

Explanation**: 
Without discount: 0->2->3 (cost 1+3=4)
With discount on edge (2,3): 0->2->3 (cost 1+1.5=2.5)
With discount on edge (1,3): 0->1->3 (cost 4+0.5=4.5)
With discount on edge (0,1): 0->1->3 (cost 2+1=3)
Best: discount on (2,3) gives cost 2.5, but since we need integer result: 2
```

## 🔍 Solution Analysis: From Brute Force to Optimal

### Approach 1: Brute Force Solution

**Key Insights from Brute Force Solution**:
- **Complete Enumeration**: Try discounting each edge and find shortest path
- **Simple Implementation**: Easy to understand and implement
- **Direct Calculation**: Use basic Dijkstra's algorithm for each discount
- **Inefficient**: O(m × (n + m) log n) time complexity

**Key Insight**: Try discounting each edge and find the shortest path for each case.

**Algorithm**:
- For each edge, apply discount and run Dijkstra's algorithm
- Keep track of minimum distance found
- Return the best result

**Visual Example**:
```
Graph: 0->1(4), 0->2(1), 1->2(2), 1->3(1), 2->3(3)
Source: 0, Destination: 3

Try discounting each edge:
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐

│ - Dijkstra: 0->2->3 (cost 1+3=4)   │
│ - Result: 4                        │
│                                   │
│ Discount edge (0,2): weight 1->0.5 │

│ - Result: 4.5                      │
│                                   │
│ Discount edge (2,3): weight 3->1.5 │
│ - Dijkstra: 0->2->3 (cost 1+1.5=2.5) │
│ - Result: 2.5                      │
│                                   │
│ Minimum: 2.5 -> 2 (integer)       │

        distances[source] = 0
        pq = [(0, source)]
        visited = [False] * n
        
        while pq:

                    new_dist = current_dist + weight
                    if new_dist < distances[neighbor]:
                        distances[neighbor] = new_dist

```

**Time Complexity**: O(m × (n + m) log n)
**Space Complexity**: O(n + m)

**Why it's inefficient**: O(m × (n + m) log n) time complexity for trying each edge discount.

### Approach 2: State Space Dijkstra

**Key Insights from State Space Dijkstra**:
- **State Space**: Use state space where each state represents (vertex, discount_used)
- **Efficient Implementation**: O((n + m) log n) time complexity
- **Priority Queue**: Use priority queue to process states by distance
- **Optimization**: Much more efficient than brute force

**Key Insight**: Use state space Dijkstra where each state tracks whether discount has been used.

**Algorithm**:
- Create states (vertex, discount_used) where discount_used is boolean
- Use Dijkstra's algorithm on the state space
- For each edge, consider both discounted and non-discounted versions
- Return minimum distance to (destination, True) or (destination, False)

**Visual Example**:
```
State space Dijkstra:

Graph: 0->1(4), 0->2(1), 1->2(2), 1->3(1), 2->3(3)
States: (vertex, discount_used)

State transitions:
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ From (0, False):                    │
│ - To (1, False): cost 4            │
│ - To (1, True): cost 2 (discount)  │
│ - To (2, False): cost 1            │
│ - To (2, True): cost 0.5 (discount) │
│                                   │
│ From (1, False):                   │
│ - To (2, False): cost 2            │
│ - To (2, True): cost 1 (discount)  │
│ - To (3, False): cost 1            │
│ - To (3, True): cost 0.5 (discount) │
│                                   │
│ From (2, False):                   │
│ - To (3, False): cost 3            │
│ - To (3, True): cost 1.5 (discount) │
│                                   │
│ Dijkstra on states:                │
│ - (0, False): distance 0           │
│ - (2, False): distance 1           │
│ - (2, True): distance 0.5          │
│ - (3, True): distance 2.5          │
│                                   │
│ Result: 2.5 -> 2 (integer)        │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

                    distances[neighbor][discount_used] = new_dist
                    heapq.heappush(pq, (new_dist, neighbor, discount_used))
            
            # Try with discount (if not used yet)
            if discount_used == 0 and not visited[neighbor][1]:
                new_dist = current_dist + weight // 2
                if new_dist < distances[neighbor][1]:

                    heapq.heappush(pq, (new_dist, neighbor, 1))
    
    # Return minimum distance to destination (with or without discount)
    return min(distances[destination][0], distances[destination][1])

# Example usage
n = 4
source = 0
destination = 3
edges = [(0, 1, 4), (0, 2, 1), (1, 2, 2), (1, 3, 1), (2, 3, 3)]
result = state_space_dijkstra_flight_discount(n, source, destination, edges)
print(f"State space Dijkstra flight discount: {result}")
```

**Time Complexity**: O((n + m) log n)
**Space Complexity**: O(n + m)

**Why it's better**: Uses state space Dijkstra for O((n + m) log n) time complexity.
