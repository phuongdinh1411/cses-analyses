## 🔍 Solution Analysis: From Brute Force to Optimal

### Approach 1: Brute Force Solution

**Key Insights from Brute Force Solution**:
- **Complete Enumeration**: Try all possible paths to find cycles
- **Simple Implementation**: Easy to understand and implement
- **Direct Calculation**: Use basic graph traversal for each path
- **Inefficient**: O(n!) time complexity

**Key Insight**: Check every possible path to find if any forms a cycle.

**Algorithm**:
- Generate all possible paths in the graph
- Check if any path forms a cycle
- Return the first cycle found

**Visual Example**:
```
Graph: 0->1, 1->2, 2->3, 3->0

All possible paths:
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Path 1: 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 0 ✓    │
│ Path 2: 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3           │
│ Path 3: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 0 -> 1 ✓    │
│ Path 4: 2 -> 3 -> 0 -> 1 -> 2 ✓    │
│ Path 5: 3 -> 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 ✓    │
│                                   │
│ Check each path:                   │
│ - Path 1: starts and ends at 0 ✓   │
│ - Path 3: starts and ends at 1 ✓   │
│ - Path 4: starts and ends at 2 ✓   │
│ - Path 5: starts and ends at 3 ✓   │
│                                   │
│ Cycles found: 1, 3, 4, 5          │
│ Return: [0, 1, 2, 3, 0]          │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Implementation**:
```python
def brute_force_cycle_finding(n, edges):
    """Find cycle using brute force approach"""
    # Build adjacency list
    adj = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for u, v in edges:
        adj[u].append(v)
    
    def find_all_paths(start, current_path, visited):
        """Find all possible paths from start"""
        if len(current_path) > 1 and current_path[0] == current_path[-1]:
            return [current_path]  # Found a cycle
        
        if len(current_path) > n:
            return []  # Path too long, no cycle
        
        paths = []
        for neighbor in adj[start]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                new_path = current_path + [neighbor]
                new_visited = visited | {neighbor}
                paths.extend(find_all_paths(neighbor, new_path, new_visited))
        
        return paths
    
    # Try starting from each vertex
    for start in range(n):
        paths = find_all_paths(start, [start], {start})
        if paths:
            return paths[0]
    
    return -1

# Example usage
n = 4
edges = [(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0)]
result = brute_force_cycle_finding(n, edges)
print(f"Brute force cycle: {result}")
```

**Time Complexity**: O(n!)
**Space Complexity**: O(n)

**Why it's inefficient**: O(n!) time complexity for checking all possible paths.

### Approach 2: DFS with Color Coding

**Key Insights from DFS with Color Coding**:
- **Color Coding**: Use three colors (white, gray, black) to track vertex states
- **Efficient Implementation**: O(n + m) time complexity
- **Cycle Detection**: Detect back edges during DFS traversal
- **Optimization**: Much more efficient than brute force

**Key Insight**: Use DFS with color coding to detect back edges that indicate cycles.

**Algorithm**:
- Use three colors: white (unvisited), gray (visiting), black (visited)
- During DFS, if we encounter a gray vertex, we found a back edge (cycle)
- Track the path to reconstruct the cycle

**Visual Example**:
```
DFS with color coding:

Graph: 0->1, 1->2, 2->3, 3->0
Colors: white (0), gray (1), black (2)

Step 1: Start DFS from 0
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Color[0] = gray (visiting)         │
│ Stack: [0]                         │
│                                   │
│ Step 2: Visit 1                    │
│ Color[1] = gray (visiting)         │
│ Stack: [0, 1]                     │
│                                   │
│ Step 3: Visit 2                    │
│ Color[2] = gray (visiting)         │
│ Stack: [0, 1, 2]                  │
│                                   │
│ Step 4: Visit 3                    │
│ Color[3] = gray (visiting)         │
│ Stack: [0, 1, 2, 3]               │
│                                   │
│ Step 5: Try to visit 0             │
│ Color[0] = gray (already visiting) │
│ Back edge found! Cycle detected!   │
│                                   │
│ Reconstruct cycle: [0, 1, 2, 3, 0] │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Implementation**:
```python
def dfs_color_coding_cycle_finding(n, edges):
    """Find cycle using DFS with color coding"""
    # Build adjacency list
    adj = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for u, v in edges:
        adj[u].append(v)
    
    # Color coding: 0=white, 1=gray, 2=black
    color = [0] * n
    parent = [-1] * n
    cycle = []
    
    def dfs(vertex):
        """DFS with color coding for cycle detection"""
        color[vertex] = 1  # Mark as gray (visiting)
        
        for neighbor in adj[vertex]:
            if color[neighbor] == 0:  # White (unvisited)
                parent[neighbor] = vertex
                if dfs(neighbor):
                    return True
            elif color[neighbor] == 1:  # Gray (visiting) - back edge found!
                # Reconstruct cycle
                cycle.append(neighbor)
                current = vertex
                while current != neighbor:
                    cycle.append(current)
                    current = parent[current]
                cycle.append(neighbor)
                cycle.reverse()
                return True
        
        color[vertex] = 2  # Mark as black (visited)
        return False
    
    # Try DFS from each unvisited vertex
    for i in range(n):
        if color[i] == 0:  # White (unvisited)
            if dfs(i):
                return cycle
    
    return -1

# Example usage
n = 4
edges = [(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0)]
result = dfs_color_coding_cycle_finding(n, edges)
print(f"DFS color coding cycle: {result}")
```

**Time Complexity**: O(n + m)
**Space Complexity**: O(n + m)

**Why it's better**: Uses DFS with color coding for O(n + m) time complexity.

## 🎯 **Template Usage Instructions**

### **Step 1: Replace Placeholders**
- Replace `[Problem Name]` with actual problem name
- Replace `[category]` with the problem category folder
- Replace `[problem_name]` with the actual problem filename
- Replace all `[placeholder]` text with actual content

### **Step 2: Customize Approaches**
- **Approach 1**: Usually brute force or naive solution
- **Approach 2**: Optimized solution (DP, greedy, etc.)
- **Approach 3**: Optimal solution (advanced algorithms)

### **Step 3: Add Visual Examples**
- Use ASCII art for diagrams
- Show step-by-step execution
- Use actual data in examples

### **Step 4: Implement Working Code**
- Write complete, runnable implementations
- Include test cases and examples
- Handle edge cases properly

### **Step 5: Add Problem Variations**
- Create 3 meaningful variations
- Provide implementations for each
- Link to related problems

### **Step 6: Quality Check**
- Ensure no redundant sections
- Verify all code works
- Check that complexity analysis is correct
- Confirm educational value is high

This template ensures consistency across all problem analyses while maintaining high educational value and practical implementation focus.
