## 🔍 Solution Analysis: From Brute Force to Optimal

### Approach 1: Brute Force
**Time Complexity**: O(n² × k)  
**Space Complexity**: O(n)

**Algorithm**:
1. For each node, perform BFS to find all nodes at distance k
2. Count the number of such nodes for each starting node
3. Sum up all counts and divide by 2 (since each path is counted twice)

**Implementation**:
```python
def brute_force_fixed_length_paths_i(n, edges, queries):
    from collections import deque, defaultdict
    
    # Build adjacency list
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    for u, v in edges:
        graph[u].append(v)
        graph[v].append(u)
    
    results = []
    
    for k in queries:
        count = 0
        
        # For each node as starting point
        for start in range(1, n + 1):
            # BFS to find nodes at distance k
            queue = deque([(start, 0)])
            visited = {start}
            
            while queue:
                node, dist = queue.popleft()
                
                if dist == k:
                    count += 1
                    continue
                
                for neighbor in graph[node]:
                    if neighbor not in visited:
                        visited.add(neighbor)
                        queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))
        
        # Each path is counted twice (from both endpoints)
        results.append(count // 2)
    
    return results
```

**Analysis**:
- **Time**: O(n² × k) - For each query, BFS from each node
- **Space**: O(n) - Queue and visited set
- **Limitations**: Too slow for large inputs

### Approach 2: Optimized with Tree DP
**Time Complexity**: O(n²)  
**Space Complexity**: O(n)

**Algorithm**:
1. Use tree DP to count paths of each length
2. For each node, count paths passing through it
3. Use rerooting technique to efficiently compute counts

**Implementation**:
```python
def optimized_fixed_length_paths_i(n, edges, queries):
    from collections import defaultdict
    
    # Build adjacency list
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    for u, v in edges:
        graph[u].append(v)
        graph[v].append(u)
    
    # Precompute all path counts
    path_counts = [0] * n
    
    def dfs(node, parent):
        # Count paths of each length passing through this node
        subtree_sizes = []
        
        for child in graph[node]:
            if child != parent:
                child_size = dfs(child, node)
                subtree_sizes.append(child_size)
        
        # Count paths of each length
        for length in range(1, n):
            count = 0
            
            # Paths within subtrees
            for size in subtree_sizes:
                if size >= length:
                    count += size - length + 1
            
            # Paths passing through this node
            for i in range(len(subtree_sizes)):
                for j in range(i + 1, len(subtree_sizes)):
                    if subtree_sizes[i] + subtree_sizes[j] >= length:
                        count += min(subtree_sizes[i], length) * min(subtree_sizes[j], length)
            
            path_counts[length] += count
        
        return sum(subtree_sizes) + 1
    
    dfs(1, -1)
    
    # Answer queries
    results = []
    for k in queries:
        results.append(path_counts[k])
    
    return results
```

**Analysis**:
- **Time**: O(n²) - Tree DP with rerooting
- **Space**: O(n) - Recursion stack and arrays
- **Improvement**: More efficient than brute force

### Approach 3: Optimal with Centroid Decomposition
**Time Complexity**: O(n log n)  
**Space Complexity**: O(n)

**Algorithm**:
1. Use centroid decomposition to divide the tree
2. For each centroid, count paths passing through it
3. Recursively solve for each subtree

**Implementation**:
```python
def optimal_fixed_length_paths_i(n, edges, queries):
    from collections import defaultdict
    
    # Build adjacency list
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    for u, v in edges:
        graph[u].append(v)
        graph[v].append(u)
    
    path_counts = [0] * n
    
    def get_centroid(node, parent, total_size):
        # Find centroid of the tree
        max_subtree = 0
        centroid = node
        
        def dfs_size(curr, par):
            nonlocal max_subtree, centroid
            size = 1
            
            for child in graph[curr]:
                if child != par:
                    child_size = dfs_size(child, curr)
                    size += child_size
                    max_subtree = max(max_subtree, child_size)
            
            if max_subtree <= total_size // 2:
                centroid = curr
            
            return size
        
        dfs_size(node, parent)
        return centroid
    
    def solve_subtree(node, parent):
        if node is None:
            return
        
        # Find centroid
        centroid = get_centroid(node, parent, n)
        
        # Count paths passing through centroid
        distances = defaultdict(int)
        
        def dfs_distances(curr, par, dist):
            distances[dist] += 1
            for child in graph[curr]:
                if child != par and child != centroid:
                    dfs_distances(child, curr, dist + 1)
        
        # Count paths of each length
        for length in range(1, n):
            count = 0
            
            # Paths within each subtree of centroid
            for child in graph[centroid]:
                if child != parent:
                    subtree_distances = defaultdict(int)
                    
                    def dfs_subtree(curr, par, dist):
                        subtree_distances[dist] += 1
                        for grandchild in graph[curr]:
                            if grandchild != par and grandchild != centroid:
                                dfs_subtree(grandchild, curr, dist + 1)
                    
                    dfs_subtree(child, centroid, 1)
                    
                    # Count paths of length k within this subtree
                    for dist in subtree_distances:
                        if dist == length:
                            count += subtree_distances[dist]
            
            path_counts[length] += count
        
        # Recursively solve for each subtree
        for child in graph[centroid]:
            if child != parent:
                solve_subtree(child, centroid)
    
    solve_subtree(1, -1)
    
    # Answer queries
    results = []
    for k in queries:
        results.append(path_counts[k])
    
    return results
