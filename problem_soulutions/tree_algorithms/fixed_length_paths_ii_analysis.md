## üìã Problem Description

You are given a tree with n nodes, where each node has a color, and q queries. Each query consists of two integers k and c. For each query, find the number of paths of length exactly k where both endpoints have color c.

**Input**: 
- First line: integer n (number of nodes)
- Second line: n integers (colors of nodes 1 to n)
- Next n-1 lines: two integers u and v (edge between nodes u and v)
- Next line: integer q (number of queries)
- Next q lines: two integers k and c

**Output**: 
- For each query, print the number of paths of length exactly k with both endpoints having color c

**Constraints**:
- 1 ‚â§ n ‚â§ 10‚Åµ
- 1 ‚â§ q ‚â§ 10‚Åµ
- 1 ‚â§ k ‚â§ n-1
- 1 ‚â§ c ‚â§ n
- Tree is connected and undirected

**Example**:
```
Input:
5
1 2 1 2 1
1 2
2 3
2 4
4 5
3
1 1
2 1
3 1

Output:
2
1
0

      |
    5(1)

Paths of length 1 with both endpoints color 1: (1,3) = 1 path
Paths of length 2 with both endpoints color 1: (1,5) = 1 path
Paths of length 3 with both endpoints color 1: none = 0 paths
```

## üîç Solution Analysis: From Brute Force to Optimal

### Approach 1: Brute Force
**Time Complexity**: O(n¬≤ √ó k)  
**Space Complexity**: O(n)

**Algorithm**:
1. For each node of the target color, perform BFS to find nodes at distance k
2. Count only nodes that also have the target color
3. Sum up all counts and divide by 2 (since each path is counted twice)

**Implementation**:
```python
def brute_force_fixed_length_paths_ii(n, colors, edges, queries):
    from collections import deque, defaultdict
    
    # Build adjacency list
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    for u, v in edges:
        graph[u].append(v)
        graph[v].append(u)
    
    results = []
    
    for k, target_color in queries:
        count = 0
        
        # For each node of target color as starting point
        for start in range(1, n + 1):
            if colors[start - 1] != target_color:
                continue
                
            # BFS to find nodes at distance k with target color
            queue = deque([(start, 0)])
            visited = {start}
            
            while queue:
                node, dist = queue.popleft()
                
                if dist == k:
                    if colors[node - 1] == target_color:
                        count += 1
                    continue
                
                for neighbor in graph[node]:
                    if neighbor not in visited:
                        visited.add(neighbor)
                        queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))
        
        # Each path is counted twice (from both endpoints)
        results.append(count // 2)
    
    return results
```

**Analysis**:
- **Time**: O(n¬≤ √ó k) - For each query, BFS from each node of target color
- **Space**: O(n) - Queue and visited set
- **Limitations**: Too slow for large inputs

### Approach 2: Optimized with Tree DP
**Time Complexity**: O(n¬≤)  
**Space Complexity**: O(n)

**Algorithm**:
1. Use tree DP to count paths of each length for each color
2. For each node, count paths passing through it with color constraints
3. Use rerooting technique to efficiently compute counts

**Implementation**:
```python
def optimized_fixed_length_paths_ii(n, colors, edges, queries):
    from collections import defaultdict
    
    # Build adjacency list
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    for u, v in edges:
        graph[u].append(v)
        graph[v].append(u)
    
    # Precompute path counts for each color and length
    path_counts = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(int))
    
    def dfs(node, parent):
        # Count paths of each length and color passing through this node
        color_counts = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(int))
        
        for child in graph[node]:
            if child != parent:
                child_counts = dfs(child, node)
                
                # Merge child counts
                for color in child_counts:
                    for length in child_counts[color]:
                        color_counts[color][length] += child_counts[color][length]
        
        # Add paths starting from this node
        node_color = colors[node - 1]
        color_counts[node_color][0] += 1
        
        # Count paths of each length
        for color in color_counts:
            for length in range(1, n):
                count = 0
                
                # Paths within subtrees
                for child in graph[node]:
                    if child != parent:
                        child_color = colors[child - 1]
                        if child_color == color:
                            count += color_counts[color].get(length - 1, 0)
                
                # Paths passing through this node
                for child1 in graph[node]:
                    if child1 == parent:
                        continue
                    for child2 in graph[node]:
                        if child2 == parent or child2 <= child1:
                            continue
                        
                        child1_color = colors[child1 - 1]
                        child2_color = colors[child2 - 1]
                        
                        if child1_color == color and child2_color == color:
                            for len1 in range(length):
                                len2 = length - len1 - 1
                                if len1 in color_counts[color] and len2 in color_counts[color]:
                                    count += color_counts[color][len1] * color_counts[color][len2]
                
                path_counts[color][length] += count
        
        return color_counts
    
    dfs(1, -1)
    
    # Answer queries
    results = []
    for k, target_color in queries:
        results.append(path_counts[target_color][k])
    
    return results
```

**Analysis**:
- **Time**: O(n¬≤) - Tree DP with rerooting
- **Space**: O(n) - Recursion stack and arrays
- **Improvement**: More efficient than brute force

### Approach 3: Optimal with Centroid Decomposition
**Time Complexity**: O(n log n)  
**Space Complexity**: O(n)

**Algorithm**:
1. Use centroid decomposition to divide the tree
2. For each centroid, count paths passing through it with color constraints
3. Recursively solve for each subtree

**Implementation**:
```python
def optimal_fixed_length_paths_ii(n, colors, edges, queries):
    from collections import defaultdict
    
    # Build adjacency list
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    for u, v in edges:
        graph[u].append(v)
        graph[v].append(u)
    
    path_counts = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(int))
    
    def get_centroid(node, parent, total_size):
        # Find centroid of the tree
        max_subtree = 0
        centroid = node
        
        def dfs_size(curr, par):
            nonlocal max_subtree, centroid
            size = 1
            
            for child in graph[curr]:
                if child != par:
                    child_size = dfs_size(child, curr)
                    size += child_size
                    max_subtree = max(max_subtree, child_size)
            
            if max_subtree <= total_size // 2:
                centroid = curr
            
            return size
        
        dfs_size(node, parent)
        return centroid
    
    def solve_subtree(node, parent):
        if node is None:
            return
        
        # Find centroid
        centroid = get_centroid(node, parent, n)
        
        # Count paths passing through centroid with color constraints
        color_distances = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(int))
        
        def dfs_distances(curr, par, dist, color):
            color_distances[color][dist] += 1
            for child in graph[curr]:
                if child != par and child != centroid:
                    dfs_distances(child, curr, dist + 1, colors[child - 1])
        
        # Count paths of each length and color
        for length in range(1, n):
            for target_color in range(1, n + 1):
                count = 0
                
                # Paths within each subtree of centroid
                for child in graph[centroid]:
                    if child != parent:
                        subtree_distances = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(int))
                        
                        def dfs_subtree(curr, par, dist, color):
                            subtree_distances[color][dist] += 1
                            for grandchild in graph[curr]:
                                if grandchild != par and grandchild != centroid:
                                    dfs_subtree(grandchild, curr, dist + 1, colors[grandchild - 1])
                        
                        dfs_subtree(child, centroid, 1, colors[child - 1])
                        
                        # Count paths of length k with target color within this subtree
                        for dist in subtree_distances[target_color]:
                            if dist == length:
                                count += subtree_distances[target_color][dist]
                
                path_counts[target_color][length] += count
        
        # Recursively solve for each subtree
        for child in graph[centroid]:
            if child != parent:
                solve_subtree(child, centroid)
    
    solve_subtree(1, -1)
    
    # Answer queries
    results = []
    for k, target_color in queries:
        results.append(path_counts[target_color][k])
    
    return results
```

**Analysis**:
- **Time**: O(n log n) - Centroid decomposition
- **Space**: O(n) - Recursion stack and arrays
- **Optimal**: Best possible complexity for this problem

    1(1)
    |
    2(2)
   / \
3(1) 4(2)
      |
    5(1)

Centroid Decomposition with Color Constraints:
1. Find centroid (node 2)
2. Count paths through centroid with color 1:
   - Length 1: (1,3) = 1 path
