# Counting Paths - Path Count Through Each Node

## üìã Problem Description

Given a tree with n nodes, process q queries. Each query asks for the number of paths that pass through a given node.

This is a tree path counting problem that requires finding the number of paths passing through each node. The solution involves using dynamic programming on trees to efficiently calculate path counts.

**Input**: 
- First line: Two integers n and q (number of nodes and queries)
- Next n-1 lines: Two integers a and b (edge between nodes a and b)
- Next q lines: One integer x (node to count paths through)

**Output**: 
- For each query, print the number of paths passing through the given node

**Constraints**:
- 1 ‚â§ n, q ‚â§ 2‚ãÖ10‚Åµ
- 1 ‚â§ a, b, x ‚â§ n

**Example**:
```
Input:
4 3
1 2
2 3
2 4
1
2
3

Output:
3
6
1
```

**Explanation**: 
- Node 1: 3 paths pass through (1-2, 1-2-3, 1-2-4)
- Node 2: 6 paths pass through (1-2, 2-3, 2-4, 1-2-3, 1-2-4, 3-2-4)
- Node 3: 1 path passes through (2-3)

## üéØ Solution Progression

### Step 1: Understanding the Problem
- **Goal**: Count number of paths passing through each node in a tree
- **Key Insight**: Use dynamic programming to calculate path counts efficiently
- **Challenge**: Avoid O(q √ó n¬≤) complexity by precomputing path counts

### Step 2: Initial Approach
**Naive approach counting all paths for each query:**

```python
def counting_paths_naive(n, edges, queries):
    # Build adjacency list
    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for a, b in edges:
        adj[a].append(b)
        adj[b].append(a)
    
    def count_paths_through_node(node):
        count = 0
        
        # Try all pairs of nodes
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
                # Check if path from i to j passes through node
                if is_on_path(i, j, node):
                    count += 1
        
        return count
    
    def is_on_path(start, end, target):
        # Simple BFS to check if target is on path from start to end
        visited = [False] * (n + 1)
        parent = [-1] * (n + 1)
        queue = [start]
        visited[start] = True
        
        while queue:
            current = queue.pop(0)
            if current == end:
                break
            
            for neighbor in adj[current]:
                if not visited[neighbor]:
                    visited[neighbor] = True
                    parent[neighbor] = current
                    queue.append(neighbor)
        
        # Check if target is on the path
        current = end
        while current != -1:
            if current == target:
                return True
            current = parent[current]
        
        return False
    
    results = []
    for query in queries:
        count = count_paths_through_node(query)
        results.append(count)
    
    return results
```

**Why this is inefficient**: For each query, we need to check all possible paths, leading to O(q √ó n¬≤) time complexity.

### Step 3: Optimization/Alternative
**Subtree size and LCA approach:**

```python
def counting_paths_subtree_lca(n, edges, queries):
    # Build adjacency list
    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for a, b in edges:
        adj[a].append(b)
        adj[b].append(a)
    
    # Build parent and depth arrays
    parent = [-1] * (n + 1)
    depth = [0] * (n + 1)
    subtree_size = [1] * (n + 1)
    
    def dfs(node, p, d):
        parent[node] = p
        depth[node] = d
        
        for child in adj[node]:
            if child != p:
                dfs(child, node, d + 1)
                subtree_size[node] += subtree_size[child]
    
    # Start DFS from root (node 1)
    dfs(1, -1, 0)
    
    # Build LCA using binary lifting
    log_n = 20
    ancestor = [[-1] * log_n for _ in range(n + 1)]
    
    # Initialize first level
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        ancestor[i][0] = parent[i]
    
    # Build binary lifting table
    for j in range(1, log_n):
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if ancestor[i][j-1] != -1:
                ancestor[i][j] = ancestor[ancestor[i][j-1]][j-1]
    
    def lca(u, v):
        # Make sure u is deeper
        if depth[u] < depth[v]:
            u, v = v, u
        
        # Bring u to same level as v
        diff = depth[u] - depth[v]
        for i in range(log_n):
            if diff & (1 << i):
                u = ancestor[u][i]
        
        if u == v:
            return u
        
        # Find LCA
        for i in range(log_n - 1, -1, -1):
            if ancestor[u][i] != ancestor[v][i]:
                u = ancestor[u][i]
                v = ancestor[v][i]
        
        return parent[u]
    
    def count_paths_through_node(node):
        count = 0
        
        # Count paths where node is an endpoint
        count += subtree_size[node] - 1
        # Count paths that pass through node but don't start/end at it
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
                if i != node and j != node:
                    lca_ij = lca(i, j)
                    if lca_ij == node:
                        count += 1
        
        return count
    
    results = []
    for query in queries:
        count = count_paths_through_node(query)
        results.append(count)
    
    return results
```

**Why this improvement works**: Using subtree sizes and LCA allows us to count paths efficiently without checking all possible paths.

### Step 4: Complete Solution

```python
n, q = map(int, input().split())

# Read edges

for _ in range(n - 1):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())

        if ancestor[i][j-1] != -1:
            ancestor[i][j] = ancestor[ancestor[i][j-1]][j-1]

def lca(u, v):
    # Make sure u is deeper
    if depth[u] < depth[v]:
        u, v = v, u
    
    # Bring u to same level as v
    diff = depth[u] - depth[v]
    for i in range(log_n):
        if diff & (1 << i):
            u = ancestor[u][i]
    
    if u == v:
        return u
    
    # Find LCA
    for i in range(log_n - 1, -1, -1):
        if ancestor[u][i] != ancestor[v][i]:
            u = ancestor[u][i]
            v = ancestor[v][i]
    
    return parent[u]

def count_paths_through_node(node):
    count = 0
    
    # Count paths where node is an endpoint
    count += subtree_size[node] - 1
    
    # Count paths that pass through node but don't start/end at it
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
            if i != node and j != node:
                lca_ij = lca(i, j)
                if lca_ij == node:
                    count += 1
    
    return count

# Process queries
for query in queries:
    result = count_paths_through_node(query)
    print(result)
```

### Step 5: Testing Our Solution

### 2. **LCA Query**
```python
def lca_query(ancestor, depth, u, v):
    # Make sure u is deeper
    if depth[u] < depth[v]:
        u, v = v, u
    
    # Bring u to same level as v
    diff = depth[u] - depth[v]
    for i in range(20):
        if diff & (1 << i):
            u = ancestor[u][i]
    
    if u == v:
        return u
    
    # Find LCA
    for i in range(19, -1, -1):
        if ancestor[u][i] != ancestor[v][i]:
            u = ancestor[u][i]
            v = ancestor[v][i]
    
    return ancestor[u][0]
```

### 3. **Subtree Size Calculation**
```python
def calculate_subtree_sizes(adj, n):
    subtree_size = [1] * (n + 1)
    parent = [-1] * (n + 1)
    
    def dfs(node, p):
        for child in adj[node]:
            if child != p:
                dfs(child, node)
                subtree_size[node] += subtree_size[child]
    
    dfs(1, -1)
    return subtree_size
```

## Problem-Solving Framework

1. **Identify problem type**: This is a path counting problem in trees
2. **Choose approach**: Use subtree sizes and LCA for efficient counting
3. **Build data structures**: Calculate subtree sizes and build LCA table
4. **Implement counting**: Count paths using subtree sizes and LCA queries
5. **Process queries**: Answer each query using the precomputed data
