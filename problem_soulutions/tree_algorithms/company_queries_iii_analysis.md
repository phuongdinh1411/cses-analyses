# Company Queries III - Number of Employees in Subtree

## üìã Problem Description

A company has n employees, numbered 1,2,‚Ä¶,n. Each employee except 1 has exactly one superior. Given q queries, for each query find the number of employees in the subtree of an employee.

This is a tree subtree size query problem that requires finding the number of nodes in each subtree. The solution involves using DFS to calculate subtree sizes efficiently.

**Input**: 
- First line: Two integers n and q (number of employees and queries)
- Second line: n-1 integers p‚ÇÇ, p‚ÇÉ, ..., p‚Çô (each p·µ¢ is the superior of employee i)
- Next q lines: One integer a (find the number of employees in the subtree of employee a)

**Output**: 
- For each query, print the number of employees in the subtree

**Constraints**:
- 1 ‚â§ n, q ‚â§ 2‚ãÖ10‚Åµ
- 1 ‚â§ p·µ¢ < i
- 1 ‚â§ a ‚â§ n

**Example**:
```
Input:
5 3
1 1 2 2
1
2
3

Output:
5
3
1
```

**Explanation**: 
- Query 1: Subtree of employee 1 contains all 5 employees
- Query 2: Subtree of employee 2 contains employees 2, 4, 5 (3 employees)
- Query 3: Subtree of employee 3 contains only employee 3 (1 employee)

## üéØ Solution Progression

### Step 1: Understanding the Problem
- **Goal**: Find the number of nodes in each subtree efficiently
- **Key Insight**: Use DFS to calculate subtree sizes in O(n) time
- **Challenge**: Handle multiple queries efficiently without O(q √ó n) complexity

### Step 2: Initial Approach
**DFS for each query (inefficient but correct):**

```python
def company_queries_dfs_each(n, q, superiors, queries):
    # Build adjacency list (tree)
    tree = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        superior = superiors[i - 2]
        tree[superior].append(i)
    
    def count_subtree_size(node):
        count = 1  # Count the node itself
        for child in tree[node]:
            count += count_subtree_size(child)
        return count
    
    # Process queries
    result = []
    for a in queries:
        result.append(count_subtree_size(a))
    
    return result
```

**Why this is inefficient**: Multiple DFS traversals become slow for large numbers of queries.

### Improvement 1: Precompute Subtree Sizes - O(n + q)
**Description**: Precompute subtree sizes using a single DFS and answer queries in O(1).

```python
def company_queries_precompute(n, q, superiors, queries):
    # Build adjacency list (tree)
    tree = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        superior = superiors[i - 2]
        tree[superior].append(i)
    
    # Array to store subtree sizes
    subtree_sizes = [0] * (n + 1)
    
    def calculate_subtree_sizes(node):
        subtree_sizes[node] = 1  # Count the node itself
        for child in tree[node]:
            subtree_sizes[node] += calculate_subtree_sizes(child)
        return subtree_sizes[node]
    
    # Calculate all subtree sizes
    calculate_subtree_sizes(1)
    
    # Process queries
    result = []
    for a in queries:
        result.append(subtree_sizes[a])
    
    return result
```

**Why this improvement works**: Single DFS precomputes all subtree sizes, making queries O(1).

### Step 3: Optimization/Alternative
**Iterative DFS:**

```python
def company_queries_iterative_dfs(n, q, superiors, queries):
    # Build adjacency list (tree)
    tree = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        superior = superiors[i - 2]
        tree[superior].append(i)
    
    # Array to store subtree sizes
    subtree_sizes = [0] * (n + 1)
    
    def calculate_subtree_sizes_iterative():
        # Use stack for iterative DFS
        stack = [(1, False)]
        
        while stack:
            node, processed = stack.pop()
            
            if processed:
                # Post-order processing
                subtree_sizes[node] = 1
                for child in tree[node]:
                    subtree_sizes[node] += subtree_sizes[child]
            else:
                # Push back with processed flag
                stack.append((node, True))
                # Push children in reverse order for correct processing
                for child in reversed(tree[node]):
                    stack.append((child, False))
    
    # Calculate all subtree sizes
    calculate_subtree_sizes_iterative()
    
    # Process queries
    result = []
    for a in queries:
        result.append(subtree_sizes[a])
    
    return result
```

**Why this improvement works**: Iterative DFS avoids recursion stack overflow for very deep trees.

### Alternative: BFS with Level Order - O(n + q)
**Description**: Use BFS with level order traversal for educational purposes.

```python
from collections import deque

def company_queries_bfs(n, q, superiors, queries):
    # Build adjacency list (tree)
    tree = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        superior = superiors[i - 2]
        tree[superior].append(i)
    
    # Array to store subtree sizes
    subtree_sizes = [0] * (n + 1)
    
    def calculate_subtree_sizes_bfs():
        # Calculate subtree sizes using BFS
        # We need to process nodes in reverse topological order
        # First, calculate in-degrees
        in_degree = [0] * (n + 1)
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            superior = superiors[i - 2]
            in_degree[superior] += 1
        
        # Use queue for processing
        queue = deque()
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if in_degree[i] == 0:
                queue.append(i)
        
        while queue:
            node = queue.popleft()
            subtree_sizes[node] = 1  # Count the node itself
            # Add children's subtree sizes
            for child in tree[node]:
                subtree_sizes[node] += subtree_sizes[child]
            
            # Update in-degree of parent
            if node > 1:
                parent = superiors[node - 2]
                in_degree[parent] -= 1
                if in_degree[parent] == 0:
                    queue.append(parent)
    
    # Calculate all subtree sizes
    calculate_subtree_sizes_bfs()
    
    # Process queries
    result = []
    for a in queries:
        result.append(subtree_sizes[a])
    
    return result
```

**Why this works**: BFS approach processes nodes in topological order, ensuring parent nodes are processed after their children.

### Step 4: Complete Solution

```python
n, q = map(int, input().split())
superiors = list(map(int, input().split()))
queries = [int(input()) for _ in range(q)]

# Build adjacency list (tree)
tree = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
for i in range(2, n + 1):
    superior = superiors[i - 2]
    tree[superior].append(i)

# Array to store subtree sizes
subtree_sizes = [0] * (n + 1)

def calculate_subtree_sizes(node):
    subtree_sizes[node] = 1  # Count the node itself
    for child in tree[node]:
        subtree_sizes[node] += calculate_subtree_sizes(child)
    return subtree_sizes[node]

# Calculate all subtree sizes
calculate_subtree_sizes(1)

# Process queries
for a in queries:
    print(subtree_sizes[a])
```

### Step 5: Testing Our Solution
**Test cases to verify correctness:**
- **Test 1**: Simple tree (should return correct subtree sizes)
- **Test 2**: Linear tree (should return correct sizes)
- **Test 3**: Star tree (should return correct sizes)
- **Test 4**: Complex tree (should find all subtree sizes)

## üîß Implementation Details

| Approach | Time Complexity | Space Complexity | Key Insight |
|----------|----------------|------------------|-------------|
| DFS for Each Query | O(q * n) | O(n) | Simple but slow |
| Precompute Subtree Sizes | O(n + q) | O(n) | Single DFS preprocessing |
| Iterative DFS | O(n + q) | O(n) | Avoid recursion stack |
| BFS | O(n + q) | O(n) | Topological order processing |

## üéØ Key Insights

## Notable Techniques

### 1. **Subtree Size Calculation Pattern**
```python
def calculate_subtree_sizes(tree, n):
    subtree_sizes = [0] * (n + 1)
    
    def dfs(node):
        subtree_sizes[node] = 1
        for child in tree[node]:
            subtree_sizes[node] += dfs(child)
        return subtree_sizes[node]
    
    dfs(1)
    return subtree_sizes
```

### 2. **Iterative DFS Pattern**
```python
def iterative_dfs_subtree_sizes(tree, n):
    subtree_sizes = [0] * (n + 1)
    stack = [(1, False)]
    
    while stack:
        node, processed = stack.pop()
        
        if processed:
            subtree_sizes[node] = 1
            for child in tree[node]:
                subtree_sizes[node] += subtree_sizes[child]
        else:
            stack.append((node, True))
            for child in reversed(tree[node]):
                stack.append((child, False))
    
    return subtree_sizes
```

### 3. **BFS Topological Pattern**
```python
def bfs_subtree_sizes(tree, superiors, n):
    subtree_sizes = [0] * (n + 1)
    in_degree = [0] * (n + 1)
    
    # Calculate in-degrees
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        parent = superiors[i - 2]
        in_degree[parent] += 1
    
    # Process in topological order
    queue = deque()
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if in_degree[i] == 0:
            queue.append(i)
    
    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        subtree_sizes[node] = 1
        
        for child in tree[node]:
            subtree_sizes[node] += subtree_sizes[child]
        
        if node > 1:
            parent = superiors[node - 2]

            if in_degree[parent] == 0:
                queue.append(parent)
    
    return subtree_sizes
```

## Edge Cases to Remember

1. **Root node**: Subtree of root contains all nodes
2. **Leaf nodes**: Subtree of leaf contains only the leaf itself
3. **Single child**: Nodes with only one child
4. **Deep trees**: Handle recursion stack properly
5. **Large queries**: Preprocess for efficiency

## Problem-Solving Framework

1. **Identify subtree nature**: This is a subtree size problem
2. **Choose approach**: Use post-order traversal for preprocessing
3. **Preprocess data**: Calculate all subtree sizes in one pass
4. **Handle queries**: Answer queries in O(1) using precomputed values
5. **Return result**: Return subtree sizes for all queries
