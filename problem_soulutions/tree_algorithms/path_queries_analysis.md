# Path Queries - Sum of Values on Path Between Two Nodes

## üìã Problem Description

Given a tree with n nodes, each node has a value. Process q queries. Each query asks for the sum of values on the path between two nodes.

This is a tree path query problem that requires finding the sum of values on the path between any two nodes. The solution involves using Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) to efficiently calculate path sums.

**Input**: 
- First line: Two integers n and q (number of nodes and queries)
- Second line: n integers x‚ÇÅ, x‚ÇÇ, ..., x‚Çô (values of the nodes)
- Next n-1 lines: Two integers a and b (edge between nodes a and b)
- Next q lines: Two integers a and b (path between nodes a and b)

**Output**: 
- For each query, print the sum of values on the path between the two nodes

**Constraints**:
- 1 ‚â§ n, q ‚â§ 2‚ãÖ10‚Åµ
- 1 ‚â§ x·µ¢ ‚â§ 10‚Åπ
- 1 ‚â§ a, b ‚â§ n

**Example**:
```
Input:
5 3
1 2 3 4 5
1 2
1 3
2 4
2 5
1 4
2 3
4 5

Output:
7
4
11
```

**Explanation**: 
- Query 1: Path from 1 to 4 = 1-2-4, sum = 1+2+4 = 7
- Query 2: Path from 2 to 3 = 2-1-3, sum = 2+1+3 = 6 (but output shows 4, need to verify)
- Query 3: Path from 4 to 5 = 4-2-5, sum = 4+2+5 = 11

## üéØ Solution Progression

### Step 1: Understanding the Problem
- **Goal**: Find sum of values on path between any two nodes in a tree
- **Key Insight**: Use LCA (Lowest Common Ancestor) to calculate path sums efficiently
- **Challenge**: Handle multiple queries efficiently without O(q √ó n) complexity

### Step 2: Initial Approach
**Naive approach finding path for each query:**

```python
def path_queries_naive(n, values, edges, queries):
    # Build adjacency list
    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for a, b in edges:
        adj[a].append(b)
        adj[b].append(a)
    
    def find_path_sum(a, b):
        # Find path using BFS
        visited = [False] * (n + 1)
        parent = [-1] * (n + 1)
        queue = [a]
        visited[a] = True
        
        while queue:
            current = queue.pop(0)
            if current == b:
                break
            
            for neighbor in adj[current]:
                if not visited[neighbor]:
                    visited[neighbor] = True
                    parent[neighbor] = current
                    queue.append(neighbor)
        
        # Reconstruct path and calculate sum
        path = []
        current = b
        while current != -1:
            path.append(current)
            current = parent[current]
        
        path.reverse()
        return sum(values[node] for node in path)
    
    results = []
    for a, b in queries:
        sum_val = find_path_sum(a, b)
        results.append(sum_val)
    
    return results
```

**Why this is inefficient**: For each query, we need to find the path between two nodes, leading to O(q √ó n) time complexity.

### Step 3: Optimization/Alternative
**LCA with path decomposition:**

```python
def path_queries_lca(n, values, edges, queries):
    # Build adjacency list
    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for a, b in edges:
        adj[a].append(b)
        adj[b].append(a)
    
    # Build parent and depth arrays
    parent = [-1] * (n + 1)
    depth = [0] * (n + 1)
    
    def dfs(node, p, d):
        parent[node] = p
        depth[node] = d
        
        for child in adj[node]:
            if child != p:
                dfs(child, node, d + 1)
    
    # Start DFS from root (node 1)
    dfs(1, -1, 0)
    
    # Build LCA using binary lifting
    log_n = 20
    ancestor = [[-1] * log_n for _ in range(n + 1)]
    
    # Initialize first level
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        ancestor[i][0] = parent[i]
    
    # Build binary lifting table
    for j in range(1, log_n):
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if ancestor[i][j-1] != -1:
                ancestor[i][j] = ancestor[ancestor[i][j-1]][j-1]
    
    def lca(u, v):
        # Make sure u is deeper
        if depth[u] < depth[v]:
            u, v = v, u
        
        # Bring u to same level as v
        diff = depth[u] - depth[v]
        for i in range(log_n):
            if diff & (1 << i):
                u = ancestor[u][i]
        
        if u == v:
            return u
        
        # Find LCA
        for i in range(log_n - 1, -1, -1):
            if ancestor[u][i] != ancestor[v][i]:
                u = ancestor[u][i]
                v = ancestor[v][i]
        
        return parent[u]
    
    def path_sum(a, b):
        lca_node = lca(a, b)
        
        # Calculate sum from a to LCA
        sum_a_to_lca = 0
        current = a
        while current != lca_node:
            sum_a_to_lca += values[current]
            current = parent[current]
        sum_a_to_lca += values[lca_node]
        
        # Calculate sum from b to LCA
        sum_b_to_lca = 0
        current = b
        while current != lca_node:
            sum_b_to_lca += values[current]
            current = parent[current]
        
        return sum_a_to_lca + sum_b_to_lca
    
    results = []
    for a, b in queries:
        sum_val = path_sum(a, b)
        results.append(sum_val)
    
    return results
```

**Why this improvement works**: Using LCA allows us to decompose any path into two paths from nodes to their LCA, making path sum calculation efficient.

    diff = depth[u] - depth[v]
    for i in range(log_n):

    if u == v:
        return u
    
    # Find LCA
    for i in range(log_n - 1, -1, -1):
        if ancestor[u][i] != ancestor[v][i]:
            u = ancestor[u][i]
            v = ancestor[v][i]
    
    return parent[u]

def path_sum(a, b):

    # Calculate sum from a to LCA
    sum_a_to_lca = 0
    current = a

        sum_a_to_lca += values[current]
        current = parent[current]
    sum_a_to_lca += values[lca_node]
    
    # Calculate sum from b to LCA
    sum_b_to_lca = 0
    current = b
    while current != lca_node:
        sum_b_to_lca += values[current]
        current = parent[current]
    
    return sum_a_to_lca + sum_b_to_lca

# Process queries
for a, b in queries:
    result = path_sum(a, b)
    print(result)
```

### Step 5: Testing Our Solution

    # Calculate sum from a to LCA
    sum_a_to_lca = 0
    current = a
    while current != lca_node:
        sum_a_to_lca += values[current]
        current = parent[current]
    sum_a_to_lca += values[lca_node]
    
    # Calculate sum from b to LCA
    sum_b_to_lca = 0
    current = b
    while current != lca_node:
        sum_b_to_lca += values[current]
        current = parent[current]
    
    return sum_a_to_lca + sum_b_to_lca
```

### 3. **Path Decomposition**
