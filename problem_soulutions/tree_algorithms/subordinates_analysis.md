# Subordinates - Tree Subtree Size Calculation

## üìã Problem Description

You are given a company hierarchy with a tree structure. The company has n employees, numbered 1,2,‚Ä¶,n. Each employee except 1 has exactly one superior. Your task is to find for each employee the number of subordinates.

This is a tree subtree size calculation problem. We need to find the size of the subtree rooted at each node, which represents the number of subordinates for each employee.

**Input**: 
- First line: Integer n (number of employees)
- Second line: n-1 integers p‚ÇÇ, p‚ÇÉ, ..., p‚Çô (superior of employee i)

**Output**: 
- n integers: number of subordinates for each employee

**Constraints**:
- 1 ‚â§ n ‚â§ 2‚ãÖ10‚Åµ
- 1 ‚â§ p·µ¢ < i

**Example**:
```
Input:
5
1 1 2 2

Output:
4 2 0 0 0
```

**Explanation**: 
- Employee 1 has 4 subordinates (2, 3, 4, 5)
- Employee 2 has 2 subordinates (3, 4)
- Employees 3, 4, 5 have 0 subordinates (leaves)
- Tree structure: 1 ‚Üí 2 ‚Üí 3, 1 ‚Üí 2 ‚Üí 4, 1 ‚Üí 5

## üéØ Solution Progression

### Step 1: Understanding the Problem
- **Goal**: Find subtree size for each node in a tree
- **Key Insight**: Use DFS to calculate subtree sizes bottom-up
- **Challenge**: Efficiently compute subtree sizes for all nodes

### Step 2: Initial Approach
**DFS with recursion to count subordinates for each node:**

```python
def subordinates_dfs(n, superiors):
    # Build adjacency list (tree)
    tree = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        superior = superiors[i - 2]  # Convert to 0-indexed
        tree[superior].append(i)
    
    def count_subordinates(node):
        count = 0
        for child in tree[node]:
            count += 1 + count_subordinates(child)
        return count
    
    # Calculate subordinates for each employee
    result = []
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        result.append(count_subordinates(i))
    
    return result
```

**Why this is efficient**: DFS naturally traverses the tree structure and counts subordinates recursively.

### Improvement 1: DFS with Memoization - O(n)
**Description**: Use DFS with memoization to avoid recalculating the same subtrees.

```python
def subordinates_dfs_memoized(n, superiors):
    # Build adjacency list (tree)
    tree = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        superior = superiors[i - 2]
        tree[superior].append(i)
    
    # Memoization cache
    memo = {}
    
    def count_subordinates(node):
        if node in memo:
            return memo[node]
        
        count = 0
        for child in tree[node]:
            count += 1 + count_subordinates(child)
        
        memo[node] = count
        return count
    
    # Calculate subordinates for each employee
    result = []
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        result.append(count_subordinates(i))
    
    return result
```

**Why this improvement works**: Memoization prevents redundant calculations for overlapping subtrees.

### Step 3: Optimization/Alternative
**Single DFS with post-order traversal:**

```python
def subordinates_single_dfs(n, superiors):
    # Build adjacency list (tree)
    tree = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        superior = superiors[i - 2]
        tree[superior].append(i)
    
    # Array to store subordinate counts
    subordinates = [0] * (n + 1)
    
    def dfs(node):
        count = 0
        for child in tree[node]:
            count += 1 + dfs(child)
        subordinates[node] = count
        return count
    
    # Start DFS from root (employee 1)
    dfs(1)
    
    # Return results for all employees
    return subordinates[1:n + 1]
```

**Why this improvement works**: Single DFS is more efficient and uses less memory than multiple recursive calls.

### Alternative: BFS with Level Order - O(n)
**Description**: Use BFS with level order traversal for educational purposes.

```python
from collections import deque

def subordinates_bfs(n, superiors):
    # Build adjacency list (tree)
    tree = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        superior = superiors[i - 2]
        tree[superior].append(i)
    
    # Array to store subordinate counts
    subordinates = [0] * (n + 1)
    
    # BFS with level order traversal
    queue = deque([1])
    visited = [False] * (n + 1)
    visited[1] = True
    
    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        
        for child in tree[node]:
            if not visited[child]:
                visited[child] = True
                queue.append(child)
                # Count this child and all its descendants
                subordinates[node] += 1 + count_descendants(child, tree)
    
    return subordinates[1:n + 1]

def count_descendants(node, tree):
    count = 0
    for child in tree[node]:
        count += 1 + count_descendants(child, tree)
    return count
```

**Why this works**: BFS approach can be useful for understanding level-based tree traversal.

### Step 4: Complete Solution

```python
n = int(input())
superiors = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Build adjacency list (tree)
tree = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
for i in range(2, n + 1):
    superior = superiors[i - 2]
    tree[superior].append(i)

# Array to store subordinate counts
subordinates = [0] * (n + 1)

def dfs(node):
    count = 0
    for child in tree[node]:
        count += 1 + dfs(child)
    subordinates[node] = count
    return count

# Start DFS from root (employee 1)
dfs(1)

# Print results for all employees
print(*subordinates[1:n + 1])
```

### Step 5: Testing Our Solution
**Test cases to verify correctness:**
- **Test 1**: Simple tree (should return correct subtree sizes)
- **Test 2**: Linear tree (should return correct counts)
- **Test 3**: Star tree (should return correct counts)
- **Test 4**: Complex tree (should find all subtree sizes)
