### Sum of Distances Calculation
```
For each node, sum distances to all other nodes:

Node 1: Sum = 0 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 6
- Distance to 1: 0
- Distance to 2: 1
- Distance to 3: 1
- Distance to 4: 2 (path: 1 ‚Üí 3 ‚Üí 4)
- Distance to 5: 2 (path: 1 ‚Üí 3 ‚Üí 5)

Node 2: Sum = 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 + 3 = 9
- Distance to 1: 1
- Distance to 2: 0
- Distance to 3: 2 (path: 2 ‚Üí 1 ‚Üí 3)
- Distance to 4: 3 (path: 2 ‚Üí 1 ‚Üí 3 ‚Üí 4)
- Distance to 5: 3 (path: 2 ‚Üí 1 ‚Üí 3 ‚Üí 5)

Node 3: Sum = 1 + 2 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 5
- Distance to 1: 1
- Distance to 2: 2 (path: 3 ‚Üí 1 ‚Üí 2)
- Distance to 3: 0
- Distance to 4: 1
- Distance to 5: 1

- Distance to 1: 2 (path: 4 ‚Üí 3 ‚Üí 1)
- Distance to 2: 3 (path: 4 ‚Üí 3 ‚Üí 1 ‚Üí 2)
- Distance to 3: 1
- Distance to 4: 0
- Distance to 5: 2 (path: 4 ‚Üí 3 ‚Üí 5)

Node 5: Sum = 2 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 0 = 8
- Distance to 1: 2 (path: 5 ‚Üí 3 ‚Üí 1)
- Distance to 2: 3 (path: 5 ‚Üí 3 ‚Üí 1 ‚Üí 2)
- Distance to 3: 1
- Distance to 4: 2 (path: 5 ‚Üí 3 ‚Üí 4)
- Distance to 5: 0
```

### Rerooting Technique
```
Start with one node (e.g., node 1) and calculate sum of distances.
Then use rerooting to calculate for other nodes:

When moving from parent to child:
- Subtract contribution of child's subtree
- Add contribution of parent's subtree
- Update distances accordingly
```

### Key Insight
Sum of distances calculation works by:
1. Using rerooting technique
2. Start with one node and calculate sum of distances
3. Move to adjacent nodes and update distances
4. Use dynamic programming to avoid recalculating
5. Time complexity: O(n) for rerooting
6. Space complexity: O(n) for storing distances

## üéØ Solution Progression

### Step 1: Understanding the Problem
- **Goal**: Find sum of distances from each node to all other nodes
- **Key Insight**: Use dynamic programming on trees with rerooting technique
- **Challenge**: Efficiently calculate distances without O(n¬≤) complexity

### Step 2: Initial Approach
**Multiple BFS approach (inefficient but correct):**

```python
from collections import deque

def tree_distances_multiple_bfs(n, edges):
    # Build adjacency list
    tree = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for a, b in edges:
        tree[a].append(b)
        tree[b].append(a)
    
    def bfs(start):
        # BFS to find distances from start node
        distances = [-1] * (n + 1)
        queue = deque([start])
        distances[start] = 0
        
        while queue:
            node = queue.popleft()
            for neighbor in tree[node]:
                if distances[neighbor] == -1:
                    distances[neighbor] = distances[node] + 1
                    queue.append(neighbor)
        
        # Return sum of distances
        return sum(distances[1:])
    
    # Calculate sum of distances for each node
    result = []
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        result.append(bfs(i))
    
    return result
```

**Why this is inefficient**: Multiple BFS approach has quadratic time complexity.

### Improvement 1: Rerooting with Subtree Sizes - O(n)
**Description**: Use rerooting technique with subtree sizes to calculate distance sums efficiently.

```python
def tree_distances_rerooting(n, edges):
    # Build adjacency list
    tree = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for a, b in edges:
        tree[a].append(b)
        tree[b].append(a)
    
    # Arrays to store subtree sizes and distance sums
    subtree_sizes = [0] * (n + 1)
    distance_sums = [0] * (n + 1)
    
    def dfs1(node, parent):
        # First DFS: calculate subtree sizes
        subtree_sizes[node] = 1
        for child in tree[node]:
            if child != parent:
                subtree_sizes[node] += dfs1(child, node)
        return subtree_sizes[node]
    
    def dfs2(node, parent, dist_sum):
        # Second DFS: calculate distance sums using rerooting
        distance_sums[node] = dist_sum
        
        for child in tree[node]:
            if child != parent: # When moving root from node to 
child: # - Nodes in child's subtree get closer by 1
                # - Nodes outside child's subtree get farther by 1
                nodes_in_subtree = subtree_sizes[child]
                nodes_outside_subtree = n - nodes_in_subtree
                
                new_dist_sum = dist_sum - nodes_in_subtree + nodes_outside_subtree
                dfs2(child, node, new_dist_sum)
    
    # Calculate initial distance sum from root
    def calculate_initial_sum(node, parent, depth):
        total = depth
        for child in tree[node]:
            if child != parent:
                total += calculate_initial_sum(child, node, depth + 1)
        return total
    
    # Start rerooting from root
    dfs1(1, -1)
    initial_sum = calculate_initial_sum(1, -1, 0)
    dfs2(1, -1, initial_sum)
    
    return distance_sums[1:n + 1]
```

**Why this improvement works**: Rerooting technique efficiently calculates distance sums for all nodes using subtree sizes.

### Step 3: Optimization/Alternative
**Single DFS with height and count calculation:**

```python
def tree_distances_single_dfs(n, edges):
    # Build adjacency list
    tree = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for a, b in edges:
        tree[a].append(b)
        tree[b].append(a)
    
    # Arrays to store subtree information
    subtree_sizes = [0] * (n + 1)
    distance_sums = [0] * (n + 1)
    
    def dfs(node, parent, depth):
        # Calculate subtree size and initial distance sum
        subtree_sizes[node] = 1
        total_distance = depth
        
        for child in tree[node]:
            if child != parent:
                child_distance = dfs(child, node, depth + 1)
                subtree_sizes[node] += subtree_sizes[child]
                total_distance += child_distance
        
        return total_distance
    
    def reroot(node, parent, current_sum):
        # Reroot the tree and update distance sums
        distance_sums[node] = current_sum
        
        for child in tree[node]:
            if child != parent:
                # Calculate new sum when moving root to child
                nodes_in_child = subtree_sizes[child]
                nodes_outside_child = n - nodes_in_child
                new_sum = current_sum - nodes_in_child + nodes_outside_child
                
                # Update subtree sizes for rerooting
                subtree_sizes[node] -= subtree_sizes[child]
                subtree_sizes[child] += subtree_sizes[node]
                
                reroot(child, node, new_sum)
                
                # Restore subtree sizes
                subtree_sizes[child] -= subtree_sizes[node]
                subtree_sizes[node] += subtree_sizes[child]
    
    # Calculate initial distance sum from root
    initial_sum = dfs(1, -1, 0)
    
    # Reroot to calculate sums for all nodes
    reroot(1, -1, initial_sum)
    
    return distance_sums[1:n + 1]
```

**Why this improvement works**: Single DFS with rerooting calculates all distance sums efficiently.

### Alternative: Dynamic Programming with Parent Tracking - O(n)
**Description**: Use dynamic programming with parent tracking for educational purposes.

```python
def tree_distances_dp(n, edges):
    # Build adjacency list
    tree = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for a, b in edges:
        tree[a].append(b)
        tree[b].append(a)
    
    # Arrays to store DP results
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    subtree_sizes = [0] * (n + 1)
    
    def dfs1(node, parent):
        # First DFS: calculate subtree sizes and initial distances
        subtree_sizes[node] = 1
        dp[node] = 0
        
        for child in tree[node]:
            if child != parent:
                child_dist = dfs1(child, node)
                subtree_sizes[node] += subtree_sizes[child]
                dp[node] += child_dist + subtree_sizes[child]
        
        return dp[node]
    
    def dfs2(node, parent, parent_sum):
        # Second DFS: calculate distance sums for all nodes
        if parent != -1:
            # Calculate distance sum for current node
            nodes_in_subtree = subtree_sizes[node]
            nodes_outside_subtree = n - nodes_in_subtree
            
            # Distance sum = parent's sum - nodes in subtree + nodes outside subtree
            dp[node] = parent_sum - nodes_in_subtree + nodes_outside_subtree
        
        for child in tree[node]:
            if child != parent:
                dfs2(child, node, dp[node])
    
    # Calculate initial distances
    dfs1(1, -1)
    
    # Calculate distance sums for all nodes
    dfs2(1, -1, dp[1])
    
    return dp[1:n + 1]
```

**Why this works**: DP approach uses parent information to calculate distance sums efficiently.

### Step 4: Complete Solution

```python
n = int(input())
edges = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n - 1)]

# Build adjacency list
tree = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
for a, b in edges:
    tree[a].append(b)
    tree[b].append(a)

# Arrays to store subtree sizes and distance sums
subtree_sizes = [0] * (n + 1)
distance_sums = [0] * (n + 1)

def dfs1(node, parent):
    # First DFS: calculate subtree sizes
    subtree_sizes[node] = 1
    for child in tree[node]:
        if child != parent:
            subtree_sizes[node] += dfs1(child, node)
    return subtree_sizes[node]

def dfs2(node, parent, dist_sum):
    # Second DFS: calculate distance sums using rerooting
    distance_sums[node] = dist_sum
    
    for child in tree[node]:
        if child != parent: # When moving root from node to 
child: # - Nodes in child's subtree get closer by 1
            # - Nodes outside child's subtree get farther by 1
            nodes_in_subtree = subtree_sizes[child]
            nodes_outside_subtree = n - nodes_in_subtree
            
            new_dist_sum = dist_sum - nodes_in_subtree + nodes_outside_subtree
            dfs2(child, node, new_dist_sum)

# Calculate initial distance sum from root
def calculate_initial_sum(node, parent, depth):
    total = depth
    for child in tree[node]:
        if child != parent:
            total += calculate_initial_sum(child, node, depth + 1)
    return total

# Start rerooting from root
dfs1(1, -1)
initial_sum = calculate_initial_sum(1, -1, 0)
dfs2(1, -1, initial_sum)

print(*distance_sums[1:n + 1])
```

### Step 5: Testing Our Solution
**Test cases to verify correctness:**
- **Test 1**: Simple tree (should return correct distance sums)
- **Test 2**: Linear tree (should return correct sums)
- **Test 3**: Star tree (should return correct sums)
- **Test 4**: Complex tree (should find all distance sums)

## Notable Techniques

### 1. **Rerooting Pattern**

def rerooting_distances(tree, n):
    subtree_sizes = [0] * (n + 1)
    distance_sums = [0] * (n + 1)
    
    def dfs1(node, parent):
        subtree_sizes[node] = 1
        for child in tree[node]:
            if child != parent:
                subtree_sizes[node] += dfs1(child, node)
        return subtree_sizes[node]
    
    def dfs2(node, parent, dist_sum):
        distance_sums[node] = dist_sum
        
        for child in tree[node]:
            if child != parent:
                nodes_in_subtree = subtree_sizes[child]
                nodes_outside_subtree = n - nodes_in_subtree
                new_dist_sum = dist_sum - nodes_in_subtree + nodes_outside_subtree
                dfs2(child, node, new_dist_sum)
    
    dfs1(1, -1)
    initial_sum = calculate_initial_sum(1, -1, 0)
    dfs2(1, -1, initial_sum)
    return distance_sums[1:n + 1]
```

### 2. **Subtree Size Pattern**
```python
def subtree_size_calculation(tree, n):
    subtree_sizes = [0] * (n + 1)
    
    def dfs(node, parent):
        subtree_sizes[node] = 1
        for child in tree[node]:
            if child != parent:
                subtree_sizes[node] += dfs(child, node)
        return subtree_sizes[node]
    
    dfs(1, -1)
    return subtree_sizes
```

### 3. **Distance Sum Pattern**
```python
def distance_sum_calculation(tree, n):
    def calculate_initial_sum(node, parent, depth):
        total = depth
        for child in tree[node]:
            if child != parent:
                total += calculate_initial_sum(child, node, depth + 1)
