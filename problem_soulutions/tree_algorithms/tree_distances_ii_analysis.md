## üîç Solution Analysis: From Brute Force to Optimal

### Approach 1: Brute Force
**Time Complexity**: O(n¬≤)  
**Space Complexity**: O(n)

**Algorithm**:
1. For each node, perform BFS to find distances to all other nodes
2. Sum up all distances for each node
3. Return the sum of distances for each node

**Implementation**:
```python
def brute_force_tree_distances_ii(n, edges):
    from collections import deque, defaultdict
    
    # Build adjacency list
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    for u, v in edges:
        graph[u].append(v)
        graph[v].append(u)
    
    results = []
    
    for start in range(1, n + 1):
        # BFS to find distances from start to all other nodes
        queue = deque([(start, 0)])
        visited = {start}
        total_distance = 0
        
        while queue:
            node, dist = queue.popleft()
            if node != start:  # Don't count distance to itself
                total_distance += dist
            
            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                if neighbor not in visited:
                    visited.add(neighbor)
                    queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))
        
        results.append(total_distance)
    
    return results
```

**Analysis**:
- **Time**: O(n¬≤) - For each node, BFS takes O(n) time
- **Space**: O(n) - Queue and visited set
- **Limitations**: Too slow for large inputs

### Approach 2: Optimized with Tree DP
**Time Complexity**: O(n)  
**Space Complexity**: O(n)

**Algorithm**:
1. Use tree DP to calculate subtree sizes and distances
2. Use rerooting technique to calculate distances from each node
3. For each node, calculate sum of distances using DP

**Implementation**:
```python
def optimized_tree_distances_ii(n, edges):
    from collections import defaultdict
    
    # Build adjacency list
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    for u, v in edges:
        graph[u].append(v)
        graph[v].append(u)
    
    # First pass: calculate subtree sizes and distances from root
    subtree_size = [0] * (n + 1)
    distances_from_root = [0] * (n + 1)
    
    def dfs1(node, parent):
        subtree_size[node] = 1
        for child in graph[node]:
            if child != parent:
                dfs1(child, node)
                subtree_size[node] += subtree_size[child]
                distances_from_root[node] += distances_from_root[child] + subtree_size[child]
    
    dfs1(1, -1)
    
    # Second pass: calculate distances from each node using rerooting
    total_distances = [0] * (n + 1)
    total_distances[1] = distances_from_root[1]
    
    def dfs2(node, parent):
        for child in graph[node]:
            if child != parent:
                # Reroot from node to child
                total_distances[child] = (total_distances[node] - 
                                        distances_from_root[child] - subtree_size[child] + 
                                        (n - subtree_size[child]))
                dfs2(child, node)
    
    dfs2(1, -1)
    
    return total_distances[1:]
```

**Analysis**:
- **Time**: O(n) - Two DFS passes
- **Space**: O(n) - Recursion stack and arrays
- **Improvement**: Much more efficient than brute force

### Approach 3: Optimal with Tree DP
**Time Complexity**: O(n)  
**Space Complexity**: O(n)

**Algorithm**:
1. Use tree DP to calculate subtree sizes and distances
2. Use rerooting technique to calculate distances from each node
3. For each node, calculate sum of distances using DP

**Implementation**:
```python
def optimal_tree_distances_ii(n, edges):
    from collections import defaultdict
    
    # Build adjacency list
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    for u, v in edges:
        graph[u].append(v)
        graph[v].append(u)
    
    # First pass: calculate subtree sizes and distances from root
    subtree_size = [0] * (n + 1)
    distances_from_root = [0] * (n + 1)
    
    def dfs1(node, parent):
        subtree_size[node] = 1
        for child in graph[node]:
            if child != parent:
                dfs1(child, node)
                subtree_size[node] += subtree_size[child]
                distances_from_root[node] += distances_from_root[child] + subtree_size[child]
    
    dfs1(1, -1)
    
    # Second pass: calculate distances from each node using rerooting
    total_distances = [0] * (n + 1)
    total_distances[1] = distances_from_root[1]
    
    def dfs2(node, parent):
        for child in graph[node]:
            if child != parent:
                # Reroot from node to child
                total_distances[child] = (total_distances[node] - 
                                        distances_from_root[child] - subtree_size[child] + 
                                        (n - subtree_size[child]))
                dfs2(child, node)
    
    dfs2(1, -1)
    
    return total_distances[1:]
```

**Analysis**:
- **Time**: O(n) - Two DFS passes
- **Space**: O(n) - Recursion stack and arrays
- **Optimal**: Best possible complexity for this problem

**Visual Example**:

    2
   / \

    |
    5

Subtree sizes:
Node 1: 5
Node 2: 4
Node 3: 1
Node 4: 2
Node 5: 1

Distances from root (1):
Node 1: 0
Node 2: 1
Node 3: 2
Node 4: 2
Node 5: 3

Total distances:
Node 1: 0 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 = 8
Node 2: 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 5
Node 3: 2 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 8
Node 4: 2 + 1 + 2 + 0 + 1 = 6
Node 5: 3 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 0 = 9
```
