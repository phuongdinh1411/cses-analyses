## Problem Description

**Problem**: Given a directed graph with n nodes and m edges, find the minimum number of new edges to add so that the graph becomes strongly connected.

**Input**: 
- n, m: number of nodes and edges
- m lines: a b (directed edge from a to b)

**Output**: Minimum number of new edges needed for strong connectivity.

**Example**:
```
Input:
4 2
1 2
3 4

Output:
2

Explanation: 
Need to add 2 edges to make graph strongly connected.
Possible solution: add edges 2‚Üí3 and 4‚Üí1.
```

### üìä Visual Example

**Input Graph:**
```
    1 ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üí 2
    3 ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üí 4
```

**Strongly Connected Components (SCCs):**
```
SCC 1: {1, 2}  ‚Üê Component 1
SCC 2: {3, 4}  ‚Üê Component 2

Condensation Graph:
SCC1 ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üí SCC2  (no edges between SCCs)
```

**Strong Connectivity Analysis:**
```
Current State:
- SCC1: {1, 2} (strongly connected)
- SCC2: {3, 4} (strongly connected)
- No path from SCC1 to SCC2
- No path from SCC2 to SCC1

Required Edges:
- Add edge from SCC1 to SCC2: 2 ‚Üí 3
- Add edge from SCC2 to SCC1: 4 ‚Üí 1

Result: 2 edges needed
```

**Final Strongly Connected Graph:**
```
    1 ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üí 2
    ‚Üë     ‚îÇ
    ‚îÇ     ‚Üì
    4 ‚Üê‚îÄ‚îÄ 3
```

**SCC Condensation Process:**
```
Step 1: Find SCCs using Kosaraju's algorithm
SCC1 = {1, 2}
SCC2 = {3, 4}

Step 2: Build condensation graph
Nodes: {SCC1, SCC2}
Edges: {} (no edges between SCCs)

Step 3: Count sources and sinks
Sources: 2 (SCC1, SCC2)
Sinks: 2 (SCC1, SCC2)

Step 4: Calculate minimum edges
min_edges = max(sources, sinks) = max(2, 2) = 2
```

## üéØ Solution Progression

### Step 1: Understanding the Problem
**What are we trying to do?**
- Find minimum edges to add for strong connectivity
- Use strongly connected components (SCCs)
- Apply graph theory concepts
- Handle condensation graph

**Key Observations:**
- This is a strong connectivity problem
- Need to find SCCs first
- Condensation graph is a DAG
- Minimum edges = max(sources, sinks)

### Step 2: Strongly Connected Components Approach
**Idea**: Use Kosaraju's algorithm to find SCCs and calculate minimum edges needed.

```python
def new_flight_routes_scc(n, m, edges):
    # Build adjacency lists
    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    adj_rev = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    
    for a, b in edges:
        adj[a].append(b)
        adj_rev[b].append(a)
    
    # Kosaraju's algorithm to find SCCs
    visited = [False] * (n + 1)
    finish_order = []
    
    def dfs1(node):
        visited[node] = True
        for neighbor in adj[node]:
            if not visited[neighbor]:
                dfs1(neighbor)
        finish_order.append(node)
    
    # First DFS to get finish order
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if not visited[i]:
            dfs1(i)
    
    # Second DFS to find SCCs
    scc_id = [0] * (n + 1)
    scc_count = 0
    
    def dfs2(node, component_id):
        scc_id[node] = component_id
        for neighbor in adj_rev[node]:
            if scc_id[neighbor] == 0:
                dfs2(neighbor, component_id)
    
    # Process nodes in reverse finish order
    for node in reversed(finish_order):
        if scc_id[node] == 0:
            scc_count += 1
            dfs2(node, scc_count)
    
    # Build condensation graph
    condensation = [[] for _ in range(scc_count + 1)]
    for a, b in edges:
        if scc_id[a] != scc_id[b]:
            condensation[scc_id[a]].append(scc_id[b])
    
    # Count sources and sinks in condensation graph
    in_degree = [0] * (scc_count + 1)
    out_degree = [0] * (scc_count + 1)
    
    for i in range(1, scc_count + 1):
        for j in condensation[i]:
            out_degree[i] += 1
            in_degree[j] += 1
    
    sources = sum(1 for i in range(1, scc_count + 1) if in_degree[i] == 0)
    sinks = sum(1 for i in range(1, scc_count + 1) if out_degree[i] == 0)
    
    # If only one SCC, no edges needed
    if scc_count == 1:
        return 0
    
    # Minimum edges needed = max(sources, sinks)
    return max(sources, sinks)
```

**Why this works:**
- Uses Kosaraju's algorithm for SCCs
- Builds condensation graph
- Counts sources and sinks
- O(n + m) time complexity

### Step 3: Complete Solution

        edges.append((a, b))
    
    # Build adjacency lists
    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    adj_rev = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    
    for a, b in edges:
        adj[a].append(b)
        adj_rev[b].append(a)
    
    # Kosaraju's algorithm to find SCCs
    visited = [False] * (n + 1)
    finish_order = []
    
    def dfs1(node):
        visited[node] = True
        for neighbor in adj[node]:
            if not visited[neighbor]:
                dfs1(neighbor)
        finish_order.append(node)
    
    # First DFS to get finish order
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if not visited[i]:
            dfs1(i)
    
    # Second DFS to find SCCs
    scc_id = [0] * (n + 1)
    scc_count = 0
    
    def dfs2(node, component_id):
        scc_id[node] = component_id
        for neighbor in adj_rev[node]:
            if scc_id[neighbor] == 0:
                dfs2(neighbor, component_id)
    
    # Process nodes in reverse finish order
    for node in reversed(finish_order):
        if scc_id[node] == 0:
            scc_count += 1
            dfs2(node, scc_count)
    
    # Build condensation graph
    condensation = [[] for _ in range(scc_count + 1)]
    for a, b in edges:
        if scc_id[a] != scc_id[b]:
            condensation[scc_id[a]].append(scc_id[b])
    
    # Count sources and sinks in condensation graph
    in_degree = [0] * (scc_count + 1)
    out_degree = [0] * (scc_count + 1)
    
    for i in range(1, scc_count + 1):
        for j in condensation[i]:
            out_degree[i] += 1
            in_degree[j] += 1
    
    sources = sum(1 for i in range(1, scc_count + 1) if in_degree[i] == 0)
    sinks = sum(1 for i in range(1, scc_count + 1) if out_degree[i] == 0)
    
    # If only one SCC, no edges needed
    if scc_count == 1:
        print(0)
    else:
        # Minimum edges needed = max(sources, sinks)
        print(max(sources, sinks))

# Main execution
if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve_new_flight_routes()
```

    scc_count = 0
    
    def dfs2(node, component_id):
        scc_id[node] = component_id
        for neighbor in adj_rev[node]:
            if scc_id[neighbor] == 0:

    # This is a more complex problem requiring bipartite matching
    # For now, return the basic solution

### Improvement 1: Strongly Connected Components - O(n + m)
**Description**: Use Kosaraju's algorithm to find SCCs and calculate minimum edges needed.

```python

    # Build adjacency lists
    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    adj_rev = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    
    for a, b in edges:

        adj_rev[b].append(a)
    
    # Kosaraju's algorithm to find SCCs
    visited = [False] * (n + 1)
    finish_order = []
    
    def first_dfs(node):
        visited[node] = True
        for neighbor in adj[node]:
            if not visited[neighbor]:
                first_dfs(neighbor)
        finish_order.append(node)
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if not visited[i]:
            first_dfs(i)
    
    visited = [False] * (n + 1)
    scc_id = [0] * (n + 1)
    current_scc = 0
    
    def second_dfs(node, scc):
        visited[node] = True
        scc_id[node] = scc
        for neighbor in adj_rev[node]:
            if not visited[neighbor]:
                second_dfs(neighbor, scc)
    
    for node in reversed(finish_order):
        if not visited[node]:
            second_dfs(node, current_scc)
            current_scc += 1
    
    # Build condensation graph
    condensation_adj = [[] for _ in range(current_scc)]
    in_degree = [0] * current_scc
    out_degree = [0] * current_scc

    # Count sources and sinks
    sources = sum(1 for i in range(current_scc) if in_degree[i] == 0)
    sinks = sum(1 for i in range(current_scc) if out_degree[i] == 0)
    
    # If only one SCC, no edges needed
    if current_scc == 1:
        return 0
    
    # Minimum edges needed = max(sources, sinks)
    return max(sources, sinks)

    for node in reversed(finish_order):
        if not visited[node]:
            second_dfs(node, current_scc)
            current_scc += 1
    
    # Build condensation graph
    condensation_adj = [[] for _ in range(current_scc)]
    in_degree = [0] * current_scc
    out_degree = [0] * current_scc
    
    for a, b in edges:
        scc_a = scc_id[a]
        scc_b = scc_id[b]
        if scc_a != scc_b:
            condensation_adj[scc_a].append(scc_b)
            in_degree[scc_b] += 1
            out_degree[scc_a] += 1
    
    # Count sources and sinks
    sources = sum(1 for i in range(current_scc) if in_degree[i] == 0)
    sinks = sum(1 for i in range(current_scc) if out_degree[i] == 0)
    
    # If only one SCC, no edges needed
    if current_scc == 1:
        return 0
    
    # Minimum edges needed = max(sources, sinks)
    return max(sources, sinks)
```

**Why this improvement works**: Optimal solution using SCC condensation analysis.

**Variation**: Each potential route has a probability of being successful.
**Approach**: Use Monte Carlo simulation or expected value calculation.
