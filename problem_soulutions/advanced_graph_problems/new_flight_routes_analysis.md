# New Flight Routes

## Problem Statement
Given a directed graph with n nodes and m edges, find the minimum number of new edges to add so that the graph becomes strongly connected.

### Input
The first input line has two integers n and m: the number of nodes and edges.
Then there are m lines describing the edges. Each line has two integers a and b: there is a directed edge from node a to node b.

### Output
Print the minimum number of new edges needed.

### Constraints
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
- 1 ≤ m ≤ 2*10^5
- 1 ≤ a,b ≤ n

### Example
```
Input:
4 2
1 2
3 4

Output:
2
```

## Solution Progression

### Approach 1: Brute Force Edge Addition - O(n²)
**Description**: Try adding edges and check if the graph becomes strongly connected.

```python
def new_flight_routes_naive(n, m, edges):
    # Build adjacency list
    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for a, b in edges:
        adj[a].append(b)
    
    def is_strongly_connected():
        # Check if every node can reach every other node
        for start in range(1, n + 1):
            visited = set()
            queue = [start]
            visited.add(start)
            
            while queue:
                node = queue.pop(0)
                for neighbor in adj[node]:
                    if neighbor not in visited:
                        visited.add(neighbor)
                        queue.append(neighbor)
            
            if len(visited) != n:
                return False
        return True
    
    if is_strongly_connected():
        return 0
    
    # Try adding edges"
    min_edges = float('inf')
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            if i != j:
                adj[i].append(j)
                if is_strongly_connected():
                    min_edges = min(min_edges, 1)
                adj[i].pop()
    
    return min_edges if min_edges != float('inf') else -1
```

**Why this is inefficient**: O(n²) complexity and doesn't handle the problem correctly.

### Improvement 1: Strongly Connected Components - O(n + m)
**Description**: Use Kosaraju's algorithm to find SCCs and calculate minimum edges needed.

```python
def new_flight_routes_improved(n, m, edges):
    # Build adjacency lists
    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    adj_rev = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    
    for a, b in edges:
        adj[a].append(b)
        adj_rev[b].append(a)
    
    # Kosaraju's algorithm to find SCCs
    visited = [False] * (n + 1)
    finish_order = []
    
    def first_dfs(node):
        visited[node] = True
        for neighbor in adj[node]:
            if not visited[neighbor]:
                first_dfs(neighbor)
        finish_order.append(node)
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if not visited[i]:
            first_dfs(i)
    
    visited = [False] * (n + 1)
    scc_id = [0] * (n + 1)
    current_scc = 0
    
    def second_dfs(node, scc):
        visited[node] = True
        scc_id[node] = scc
        for neighbor in adj_rev[node]:
            if not visited[neighbor]:
                second_dfs(neighbor, scc)
    
    for node in reversed(finish_order):
        if not visited[node]:
            second_dfs(node, current_scc)
            current_scc += 1
    
    # Build condensation graph
    condensation_adj = [[] for _ in range(current_scc)]
    in_degree = [0] * current_scc
    out_degree = [0] * current_scc
    
    for a, b in edges:
        scc_a = scc_id[a]
        scc_b = scc_id[b]
        if scc_a != scc_b:
            condensation_adj[scc_a].append(scc_b)
            in_degree[scc_b] += 1
            out_degree[scc_a] += 1
    
    # Count sources and sinks
    sources = sum(1 for i in range(current_scc) if in_degree[i] == 0)
    sinks = sum(1 for i in range(current_scc) if out_degree[i] == 0)
    
    # If only one SCC, no edges needed
    if current_scc == 1:
        return 0
    
    # Minimum edges needed = max(sources, sinks)
    return max(sources, sinks)
```

**Why this improvement works**: Uses SCC condensation to determine minimum edges needed.

### Approach 2: Optimal SCC Analysis - O(n + m)
**Description**: Optimized SCC analysis with better implementation.

```python
def new_flight_routes_optimal(n, m, edges):
    # Build adjacency lists
    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    adj_rev = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    
    for a, b in edges:
        adj[a].append(b)
        adj_rev[b].append(a)
    
    # Kosaraju's algorithm to find SCCs
    visited = [False] * (n + 1)
    finish_order = []
    
    def first_dfs(node):
        visited[node] = True
        for neighbor in adj[node]:
            if not visited[neighbor]:
                first_dfs(neighbor)
        finish_order.append(node)
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if not visited[i]:
            first_dfs(i)
    
    visited = [False] * (n + 1)
    scc_id = [0] * (n + 1)
    current_scc = 0
    
    def second_dfs(node, scc):
        visited[node] = True
        scc_id[node] = scc
        for neighbor in adj_rev[node]:
            if not visited[neighbor]:
                second_dfs(neighbor, scc)
    
    for node in reversed(finish_order):
        if not visited[node]:
            second_dfs(node, current_scc)
            current_scc += 1
    
    # Build condensation graph
    condensation_adj = [[] for _ in range(current_scc)]
    in_degree = [0] * current_scc
    out_degree = [0] * current_scc
    
    for a, b in edges:
        scc_a = scc_id[a]
        scc_b = scc_id[b]
        if scc_a != scc_b:
            condensation_adj[scc_a].append(scc_b)
            in_degree[scc_b] += 1
            out_degree[scc_a] += 1
    
    # Count sources and sinks
    sources = sum(1 for i in range(current_scc) if in_degree[i] == 0)
    sinks = sum(1 for i in range(current_scc) if out_degree[i] == 0)
    
    # If only one SCC, no edges needed
    if current_scc == 1:
        return 0
    
    # Minimum edges needed = max(sources, sinks)
    return max(sources, sinks)
```

**Why this improvement works**: Optimal solution using SCC condensation analysis.

## Final Optimal Solution

        if scc_a != scc_b:

    # If only one SCC, no edges needed
    if current_scc == 1:
        return 0
    
    # Minimum edges needed = max(sources, sinks)
    return max(sources, sinks)

result = find_minimum_new_edges(n, m, edges)
print(result)
```

## Problem Variations & Related Questions

### Problem Variations

#### 1. **New Flight Routes with Costs**
**Variation**: Each new route has a different cost, find minimum cost to make graph strongly connected.
**Approach**: Use weighted SCC analysis with cost optimization.

```

#### 2. **New Flight Routes with Constraints**
**Variation**: Limited budget, restricted routes, or specific connectivity requirements.
**Approach**: Use constraint satisfaction with SCC analysis.
```python
def constrained_new_flight_routes(n, m, edges, budget, restricted_routes, required_connections):
    # budget = maximum cost allowed
    # restricted_routes = set of routes that cannot be added
    # required_connections = set of required connections

#### 3. **New Flight Routes with Probabilities**
**Variation**: Each potential route has a probability of being successful.
**Approach**: Use Monte Carlo simulation or expected value calculation.
```python
def probabilistic_new_flight_routes(n, m, edges, route_probabilities):
    # route_probabilities[(a, b)] = probability route from a to b will be successful
    
    def monte_carlo_simulation(trials=1000):
        successful_connections = 0
        
        for _ in range(trials):
            if can_make_strongly_connected_with_probabilities(n, m, edges, route_probabilities):
                successful_connections += 1
        
        return successful_connections / trials

#### 4. **New Flight Routes with Multiple Criteria**
**Variation**: Optimize for multiple objectives (cost, time, reliability, capacity).
**Approach**: Use multi-objective optimization or weighted sum approach.
```python

                criteria_weights['reliability'] * route_attributes['reliability'] +
