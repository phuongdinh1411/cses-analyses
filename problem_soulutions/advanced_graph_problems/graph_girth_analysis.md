# Graph Girth

## Problem Description

**Problem**: Given an undirected graph, find the length of the shortest cycle (girth).

**Input**: 
- n: number of vertices
- m: number of edges
- m lines: a b (edge between vertices a and b)

**Output**: Length of the shortest cycle, or -1 if no cycle exists.

**Example**:
```
Input:
4 4
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 1

Output:
4

Explanation: 
The shortest cycle is 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 with length 4.
```

## 🎯 Solution Progression

### Step 1: Understanding the Problem
**What are we trying to do?**
- Find the shortest cycle in an undirected graph
- Use graph algorithms and cycle detection
- Apply BFS or DFS approaches
- Handle cases with no cycles

**Key Observations:**
- This is a cycle detection problem
- Need to find shortest cycle length
- Can use BFS from each vertex
- Girth is the minimum cycle length

### Step 2: BFS Approach
**Idea**: Use BFS from each vertex to find shortest cycles.

```python
def graph_girth_bfs(n, edges):
    # Build adjacency list
    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for a, b in edges:
        adj[a].append(b)
        adj[b].append(a)
    
    min_cycle = float('inf')
    
    # Try BFS from each vertex
    for start in range(1, n + 1):
        # BFS to find shortest cycle containing start
        from collections import deque
        queue = deque([(start, -1, 0)])  # (node, parent, distance)
        visited = {start: 0}
        
        while queue:
            node, parent, dist = queue.popleft()
            
            for neighbor in adj[node]:
                if neighbor == parent:
                    continue
                
                if neighbor in visited:
                    # Found a cycle
                    cycle_length = dist + visited[neighbor] + 1
                    min_cycle = min(min_cycle, cycle_length)
                else:
                    visited[neighbor] = dist + 1
                    queue.append((neighbor, node, dist + 1))
    
    return min_cycle if min_cycle != float('inf') else -1
```

**Why this works:**
- Uses BFS to find shortest paths
- Detects cycles efficiently
- Handles all vertex pairs
- O(n² + nm) time complexity

### Step 3: Complete Solution
**Putting it all together:**

```python
def solve_graph_girth():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    edges = []
    
    for _ in range(m):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        edges.append((a, b))
    
    # Build adjacency list
    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for a, b in edges:
        adj[a].append(b)
        adj[b].append(a)
    
    min_cycle = float('inf')
    
    # Try BFS from each vertex
    for start in range(1, n + 1):
        # BFS to find shortest cycle containing start
        from collections import deque
        queue = deque([(start, -1, 0)])  # (node, parent, distance)
        visited = {start: 0}
        
        while queue:
            node, parent, dist = queue.popleft()
            
            for neighbor in adj[node]:
                if neighbor == parent:
                    continue
                
                if neighbor in visited:
                    # Found a cycle
                    cycle_length = dist + visited[neighbor] + 1
                    min_cycle = min(min_cycle, cycle_length)
                else:
                    visited[neighbor] = dist + 1
                    queue.append((neighbor, node, dist + 1))
    
    result = min_cycle if min_cycle != float('inf') else -1
    print(result)

# Main execution
if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve_graph_girth()
```

**Why this works:**
- Optimal BFS-based approach
- Handles all edge cases
- Efficient implementation
- Clear and readable code

**Let's verify with examples:**

```python
def test_solution():
    test_cases = [
        (4, 4, [(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1)]),
        (3, 2, [(1, 2), (2, 3)]),
        (5, 5, [(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 1)]),
    ]
    
    for n, m, edges in test_cases:
        result = solve_test(n, m, edges)
        print(f"n={n}, m={m}, edges={edges}")
        print(f"Result: {result}")
        print()

def solve_test(n, m, edges):
    # Build adjacency list

    for a, b in edges:
        adj[a].append(b)
        adj[b].append(a)
    
    min_cycle = float('inf')
    
    # Try BFS from each vertex
    for start in range(1, n + 1):
        # BFS to find shortest cycle containing start
        from collections import deque
        queue = deque([(start, -1, 0)])  # (node, parent, distance)
        visited = {start: 0}
        
        while queue:
            node, parent, dist = queue.popleft()
            
            for neighbor in adj[node]:
                if neighbor == parent:
                    continue
                
                if neighbor in visited:
                    # Found a cycle
                    cycle_length = dist + visited[neighbor] + 1
                    min_cycle = min(min_cycle, cycle_length)
                else:
                    visited[neighbor] = dist + 1
                    queue.append((neighbor, node, dist + 1))
    
    return min_cycle if min_cycle != float('inf') else -1

## 🎯 Problem Variations

### Variation 1: Graph Girth with Weights
**Problem**: Each edge has a weight, find shortest weighted cycle.

```python
def weighted_graph_girth(n, edges, weights):
    # Build adjacency list
    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for a, b in edges:
        weight = weights.get((a, b), 1)
        adj[a].append((b, weight))
        adj[b].append((a, weight))
    
    min_cycle = float('inf')
    
    # Try BFS from each vertex
    for start in range(1, n + 1):
        # BFS to find shortest weighted cycle containing start
        from collections import deque
        queue = deque([(start, -1, 0)])  # (node, parent, distance)
        visited = {start: 0}
        
        while queue:
            node, parent, dist = queue.popleft()
            
            for neighbor, weight in adj[node]:
                if neighbor == parent:
                    continue
                
                if neighbor in visited:
                    # Found a cycle
                    cycle_length = dist + visited[neighbor] + weight
                    min_cycle = min(min_cycle, cycle_length)
                else:
                    visited[neighbor] = dist + weight
                    queue.append((neighbor, node, dist + weight))
    
    return min_cycle if min_cycle != float('inf') else -1
```

### Variation 2: Graph Girth with Constraints
**Problem**: Find shortest cycle avoiding certain edges.

```python
def constrained_graph_girth(n, edges, forbidden_edges):
    # Build adjacency list
    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for a, b in edges:
        if (a, b) not in forbidden_edges and (b, a) not in forbidden_edges:
            adj[a].append(b)
            adj[b].append(a)
    
    min_cycle = float('inf')
    
    # Try BFS from each vertex
    for start in range(1, n + 1):
        # BFS to find shortest cycle containing start
        from collections import deque
        queue = deque([(start, -1, 0)])  # (node, parent, distance)
        visited = {start: 0}
        
        while queue:
            node, parent, dist = queue.popleft()
            
            for neighbor in adj[node]:
                if neighbor == parent:
                    continue
                
                if neighbor in visited:
                    # Found a cycle
                    cycle_length = dist + visited[neighbor] + 1
                    min_cycle = min(min_cycle, cycle_length)
                else:
                    visited[neighbor] = dist + 1
                    queue.append((neighbor, node, dist + 1))
    
    return min_cycle if min_cycle != float('inf') else -1
```

### Variation 3: Dynamic Graph Girth
**Problem**: Support adding/removing edges and maintaining girth.

```python
class DynamicGraphGirth:
    def __init__(self, n):
        self.n = n
        self.adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
        self.edges = set()
    
    def add_edge(self, a, b):
        if (a, b) not in self.edges and (b, a) not in self.edges:
            self.edges.add((a, b))
            self.adj[a].append(b)
            self.adj[b].append(a)
    
    def remove_edge(self, a, b):
        if (a, b) in self.edges:
            self.edges.remove((a, b))
            self.adj[a].remove(b)
            self.adj[b].remove(a)
            return True
        elif (b, a) in self.edges:
            self.edges.remove((b, a))
            self.adj[a].remove(b)
            self.adj[b].remove(a)
            return True
        return False
    
    def get_girth(self):
        min_cycle = float('inf')
        
        # Try BFS from each vertex
        for start in range(1, self.n + 1):
            # BFS to find shortest cycle containing start
            from collections import deque
            queue = deque([(start, -1, 0)])  # (node, parent, distance)
            visited = {start: 0}
            
            while queue:
                node, parent, dist = queue.popleft()
                
                for neighbor in self.adj[node]:
                    if neighbor == parent:
                        continue
                    
                    if neighbor in visited:
                        # Found a cycle
                        cycle_length = dist + visited[neighbor] + 1
                        min_cycle = min(min_cycle, cycle_length)
                    else:
                        visited[neighbor] = dist + 1
                        queue.append((neighbor, node, dist + 1))
        
        return min_cycle if min_cycle != float('inf') else -1
```

### Variation 4: Graph Girth with Multiple Constraints
**Problem**: Find shortest cycle satisfying multiple constraints.

```python
def multi_constrained_graph_girth(n, edges, constraints):
    # Build adjacency list
    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    forbidden_edges = constraints.get('forbidden_edges', set())
    allowed_nodes = constraints.get('allowed_nodes', set(range(1, n + 1)))
    
    for a, b in edges:
        if (a, b) not in forbidden_edges and (b, a) not in forbidden_edges:
            if a in allowed_nodes and b in allowed_nodes:
                adj[a].append(b)
                adj[b].append(a)
    
    min_cycle = float('inf')
    
    # Try BFS from each allowed vertex
    for start in allowed_nodes:
        # BFS to find shortest cycle containing start
        from collections import deque
        queue = deque([(start, -1, 0)])  # (node, parent, distance)
        visited = {start: 0}
        
        while queue:
            node, parent, dist = queue.popleft()
            
            for neighbor in adj[node]:
                if neighbor == parent:
                    continue
                
                if neighbor in visited:
                    # Found a cycle
                    cycle_length = dist + visited[neighbor] + 1
                    min_cycle = min(min_cycle, cycle_length)
                else:
                    visited[neighbor] = dist + 1
                    queue.append((neighbor, node, dist + 1))
    
    return min_cycle if min_cycle != float('inf') else -1
```

### Variation 5: Graph Girth with Edge Weights
**Problem**: Each edge has a weight, find shortest weighted cycle.

```python
def weighted_graph_girth_optimized(n, edges, weights):
    # Build adjacency list
    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for a, b in edges:
        weight = weights.get((a, b), 1)
        adj[a].append((b, weight))
        adj[b].append((a, weight))
    
    min_cycle = float('inf')
    
    # Try BFS from each vertex
    for start in range(1, n + 1):
        # BFS to find shortest weighted cycle containing start
        from collections import deque
        queue = deque([(start, -1, 0)])  # (node, parent, distance)
        visited = {start: 0}
        
        while queue:
            node, parent, dist = queue.popleft()
            
            for neighbor, weight in adj[node]:
                if neighbor == parent:
                    continue
                
                if neighbor in visited:
                    # Found a cycle
                    cycle_length = dist + visited[neighbor] + weight
                    min_cycle = min(min_cycle, cycle_length)
                else:
                    visited[neighbor] = dist + weight
                    queue.append((neighbor, node, dist + weight))
    
    return min_cycle if min_cycle != float('inf') else -1
```

                else:
                    visited[neighbor] = dist + 1
                    queue.append((neighbor, node, dist + 1))
    
    result = min_cycle if min_cycle != float('inf') else -1
    print(result)

        adj[b].append(a)
    
    cycles = []
    
    # Try BFS from each vertex
    for start in range(1, n + 1):
        # BFS to find all cycles containing start
        from collections import deque
        queue = deque([(start, -1, 0)])  # (node, parent, distance)

### Variation 5: Girth with Node Weights
**Problem**: Each node has a weight. Find cycle with minimum total node weight.

```python
def node_weighted_girth(n, edges, node_weights):
    # Build adjacency list
    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for a, b in edges:
        adj[a].append(b)
        adj[b].append(a)
    
    min_cycle_weight = float('inf')
    
    # Try BFS from each vertex
    for start in range(1, n + 1):
        # BFS to find shortest cycle containing start
        from collections import deque
        queue = deque([(start, -1, 0, {start})])  # (node, parent, weight, visited_nodes)
        
        while queue:
            node, parent, weight, visited_nodes = queue.popleft()
            
            for neighbor in adj[node]:
                if neighbor == parent:
                    continue
                
                if neighbor in visited_nodes:
                    # Found a cycle
                    cycle_weight = weight + node_weights[neighbor]
                    min_cycle_weight = min(min_cycle_weight, cycle_weight)
                else:
                    new_visited = visited_nodes.copy()
                    new_visited.add(neighbor)
                    new_weight = weight + node_weights[neighbor]
                    queue.append((neighbor, node, new_weight, new_visited))
    
    return min_cycle_weight if min_cycle_weight != float('inf') else -1
```
