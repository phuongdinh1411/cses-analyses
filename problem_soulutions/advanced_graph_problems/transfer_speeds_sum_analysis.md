```

### ðŸ“Š Visual Example

**Input Network:**
```
    1 â”€â”€10â”€â”€ 2 â”€â”€5â”€â”€ 3 â”€â”€8â”€â”€ 4
    â”‚        â”‚        â”‚
    â”‚15      â”‚12      â”‚
    â”‚        â”‚        â”‚
    â””â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”´â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”˜
```

**Maximum Flow Analysis:**
```
Source: 1, Sink: 4

Path 1: 1 â†’ 2 â†’ 3 â†’ 4
Flow: min(10, 5, 8) = 5
Residual: 1â†’2: 5, 2â†’3: 0, 3â†’4: 3

Path 2: 1 â†’ 3 â†’ 4
Flow: min(15, 3) = 3
Residual: 1â†’3: 12, 3â†’4: 0

Path 3: 1 â†’ 2 â†’ 4
Flow: min(5, 12) = 5
Residual: 1â†’2: 0, 2â†’4: 7

Total flow: 5 + 3 + 5 = 13
```

**Network Flow Visualization:**
```
Initial Capacities:
    1 â”€â”€10â”€â”€ 2 â”€â”€5â”€â”€ 3 â”€â”€8â”€â”€ 4
    â”‚        â”‚        â”‚

    â””â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”´â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”˜

After Maximum Flow:
    1 â”€â”€0â”€â”€ 2 â”€â”€0â”€â”€ 3 â”€â”€0â”€â”€ 4
    â”‚        â”‚        â”‚

    â””â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”´â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”˜

Flow paths:
- 1â†’2â†’3â†’4: flow = 5
- 1â†’3â†’4: flow = 3  
- 1â†’2â†’4: flow = 5
Total: 13
```

**Maximum Sum Calculation:**
```
Edge utilization:
- (1,2): 10/10 = 100% â†’ 10
- (2,3): 5/5 = 100% â†’ 5
- (3,4): 8/8 = 100% â†’ 8
- (1,3): 3/15 = 20% â†’ 3
- (2,4): 5/12 = 42% â†’ 5

Total sum: 10 + 5 + 8 + 3 + 5 = 31
```

**Alternative Interpretation (Maximum Weight Matching):**
```
If this is a matching problem:
Select edges: (1,2), (3,4), (2,4)
Sum: 10 + 8 + 12 = 30

Or select: (1,3), (2,4)
Sum: 15 + 12 = 27

Maximum: 30
```

### Step 1: Understanding the Problem
**What are we trying to do?**
- Find maximum sum of transfer speeds
- Use graph algorithms
- Apply maximum flow or matching
- Optimize network utilization

**Key Observations:**
- This is a maximum flow problem
- Need to find optimal path allocation

### Step 2: Maximum Flow Approach
**Idea**: Use maximum flow algorithm to find optimal transfer speeds.

```python
def transfer_speeds_max_flow(n, connections):
    # Build capacity matrix
    capacity = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for a, b, speed in connections:
        capacity[a][b] = speed
    
    # Ford-Fulkerson algorithm
    def max_flow(source, sink):
        flow = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
        max_flow_value = 0
        
        while True:
            # Find augmenting path using BFS
            parent = [-1] * (n + 1)
            parent[source] = source
            queue = [source]
            
            while queue and parent[sink] == -1:
                u = queue.pop(0)
                for v in range(1, n + 1):
                    if parent[v] == -1 and capacity[u][v] > flow[u][v]:
                        parent[v] = u
                        queue.append(v)
            
            if parent[sink] == -1:
                break
            
            # Find minimum residual capacity
            path_flow = float('inf')
            v = sink
            while v != source:
                u = parent[v]
                path_flow = min(path_flow, capacity[u][v] - flow[u][v])
                v = u
            
            # Update flow
            v = sink
            while v != source:
                u = parent[v]
                flow[u][v] += path_flow
                flow[v][u] -= path_flow
                v = u
            
            max_flow_value += path_flow
        
        return max_flow_value
    
    return max_flow(1, n)
```

**Why this works:**
- Uses Ford-Fulkerson maximum flow algorithm
- Finds optimal network utilization
- Handles capacity constraints
- O(nmÂ²) time complexity

    connections = []
    
    for _ in range(m):
        a, b, speed = map(int, input().split())
        connections.append((a, b, speed))
    
    # Build capacity matrix
    capacity = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for a, b, speed in connections:
        capacity[a][b] = speed
    
    # Ford-Fulkerson algorithm
    def max_flow(source, sink):
        flow = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
        max_flow_value = 0
        
        while True:
            # Find augmenting path using BFS
            parent = [-1] * (n + 1)
            parent[source] = source
            queue = [source]
            
            while queue and parent[sink] == -1:
                u = queue.pop(0)
                for v in range(1, n + 1):
                    if parent[v] == -1 and capacity[u][v] > flow[u][v]:
                        parent[v] = u
                        queue.append(v)
            
            if parent[sink] == -1:
                break
            
            # Find minimum residual capacity
            path_flow = float('inf')
            v = sink
            while v != source:
                u = parent[v]
                path_flow = min(path_flow, capacity[u][v] - flow[u][v])
                v = u
            
            # Update flow
            v = sink
            while v != source:
                u = parent[v]
                flow[u][v] += path_flow
                flow[v][u] -= path_flow
                v = u
            
            max_flow_value += path_flow
        
        return max_flow_value
    
    result = max_flow(1, n)
    print(result)

# Main execution
if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve_transfer_speeds_sum()
```

    # Remove forbidden edges
    for a, b in forbidden_edges:
        capacity[a][b] = 0
    
    # Apply capacity limits
    for i in range(1, n + 1):

        return max_flow_value
    
    return max_flow(super_source, n)
```

    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for a, b, speed in connections:
        adj[a].append((b, speed))
    
    # Dijkstra's algorithm for maximum path
    from heapq import heappush, heappop
    
    distances = [-float('inf')] * (n + 1)
    distances[source] = 0
    pq = [(0, source)]
    
    while pq:
        dist, node = heappop(pq)
        dist = -dist  # Convert back to positive
        
        if node == sink:
            return dist
        
        if dist < distances[node]:
            continue
        
        for neighbor, speed in adj[node]:
            new_dist = min(dist, speed)  # Minimum speed on path

                heappush(pq, (-new_dist, neighbor))
    
    return distances[sink] if distances[sink] != -float('inf') else 0
```

    # Build adjacency list
    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for a, b, speed in connections:
        adj[a].append((b, speed))
    
    # Binary search for optimal speed
    def can_achieve_throughput(target):
        # Check if we can achieve target throughput
        # This would involve more complex flow analysis
        return True  # Simplified

            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    
    return result

        if (a, b) not in constraints:
            total_sum += speed
    
    return total_sum
```

### Variation 4: Dynamic Transfer Speeds

    def __init__(self, n):
        self.n = n
        self.connections = {}
        self.total_sum = 0
    
    def add_connection(self, a, b, speed):
        if (a, b) not in self.connections:

            self.total_sum += speed
    
    def remove_connection(self, a, b):
        if (a, b) in self.connections:
            self.total_sum -= self.connections[(a, b)]
            del self.connections[(a, b)]
    
    def get_total_sum(self):
        return self.total_sum
    
    def update_speed(self, a, b, new_speed):
        if (a, b) in self.connections:
            self.total_sum -= self.connections[(a, b)]
            self.connections[(a, b)] = new_speed
            self.total_sum += new_speed
```

### Variation 5: Transfer Speed Analysis
**Problem**: Analyze transfer speed patterns and statistics.

```python
def transfer_speed_analysis(n, connections):
    # Calculate various statistics
    speeds = [speed for _, _, speed in connections]
    
    stats = {
        'total_sum': sum(speeds),
        'average_speed': sum(speeds) / len(speeds) if speeds else 0,
        'max_speed': max(speeds) if speeds else 0,
        'min_speed': min(speeds) if speeds else 0,
        'speed_count': len(speeds)
    }
    
    # Speed distribution
    speed_freq = {}
    for speed in speeds:
        speed_freq[speed] = speed_freq.get(speed, 0) + 1
    
    stats['speed_distribution'] = speed_freq
    
    return stats

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Variations

### Variation 1: Multiple Sources and Sinks
**Problem**: Multiple source and sink nodes.

```python
def transfer_speeds_multiple_sources(n, connections, sources, sinks):
    # Add super source and super sink
    super_source = 0
    super_sink = n + 1
    
    # Build capacity matrix
    capacity = [[0] * (n + 2) for _ in range(n + 2)]
    for a, b, speed in connections:
        capacity[a][b] = speed
    
    # Connect super source to sources
    for source in sources:
        capacity[super_source][source] = float('inf')
    
    # Connect sinks to super sink
    for sink in sinks:
        capacity[sink][super_sink] = float('inf')
    
    # Use Ford-Fulkerson
    return max_flow(super_source, super_sink)
```

### Variation 2: Minimum Cost Flow
**Problem**: Each connection has a cost. Find minimum cost for maximum flow.

```python
def transfer_speeds_min_cost(n, connections):
    # Similar to main solution but with cost optimization
    # Implementation details...
    pass
```

### Variation 3: Dynamic Network
**Problem**: Support adding/removing connections dynamically.

```python
class DynamicTransferNetwork:
    def __init__(self, n):
        self.n = n
        self.capacity = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    
    def add_connection(self, a, b, speed):
        self.capacity[a][b] = speed
    
    def remove_connection(self, a, b):
        self.capacity[a][b] = 0
    
    def get_max_flow(self, source, sink):
        # Ford-Fulkerson implementation
        # Implementation details...
        pass
```
