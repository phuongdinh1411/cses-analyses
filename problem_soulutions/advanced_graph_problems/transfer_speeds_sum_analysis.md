# Transfer Speeds Sum

## Problem Statement
Given a directed graph with n nodes and m edges, where each edge has a transfer speed, find the sum of all transfer speeds between all pairs of nodes.

### Input
The first input line has two integers n and m: the number of nodes and edges.
Then there are m lines describing the edges. Each line has three integers a, b, and c: there is an edge from node a to node b with transfer speed c.

### Output
Print the sum of all transfer speeds between all pairs of nodes.

### Constraints
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000
- 1 ≤ m ≤ 5000
- 1 ≤ a,b ≤ n
- 1 ≤ c ≤ 10^9

### Example
```
Input:
3 3
1 2 5
2 3 3
1 3 10

Output:
18
```

## Solution Progression

### Approach 1: Brute Force Sum - O(n²m)
**Description**: For each pair of nodes, sum up all transfer speeds between them.

```python
def transfer_speeds_sum_naive(n, m, edges):
    # Build adjacency list with speeds
    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for a, b, c in edges:
        adj[a].append((b, c))
    
    total_sum = 0
    
    # For each pair of nodes
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            if i != j:
                # Sum all transfer speeds from i to j
                for neighbor, speed in adj[i]:
                    if neighbor == j:
                        total_sum += speed
    
    return total_sum
```"
**Why this is inefficient**: This approach has O(n²m) complexity and doesn't handle the problem correctly.

### Improvement 1: Direct Edge Sum - O(m)
**Description**: Simply sum up all edge weights since we want the sum of all transfer speeds.

```python
def transfer_speeds_sum_improved(n, m, edges):
    total_sum = 0
    
    # Sum all edge weights
    for a, b, c in edges:
        total_sum += c
    
    return total_sum
```

**Why this improvement works**: The problem asks for the sum of all transfer speeds, which is simply the sum of all edge weights.

### Approach 2: Optimized Sum Calculation - O(m)
**Description**: Use efficient sum calculation with proper handling.

```python
def transfer_speeds_sum_optimal(n, m, edges):
    total_sum = 0
    
    # Sum all transfer speeds
    for a, b, c in edges:
        total_sum += c
    
    return total_sum
```

**Why this improvement works**: The optimal solution is simply to sum all edge weights.

## Final Optimal Solution

```python
n, m = map(int, input().split())
edges = []
for _ in range(m):
    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
    edges.append((a, b, c))

def calculate_transfer_speeds_sum(n, m, edges):
    total_sum = 0
    
    # Sum all transfer speeds
    for a, b, c in edges:
        total_sum += c
    
    return total_sum

result = calculate_transfer_speeds_sum(n, m, edges)
print(result)
```

## Problem Variations & Related Questions

### Problem Variations

#### 1. **Transfer Speeds Sum with Costs**
**Variation**: Each transfer has additional costs beyond speed, find total cost.
**Approach**: Use weighted sum calculation with cost tracking.
```python
def cost_based_transfer_speeds_sum(n, m, edges, transfer_costs):
    # transfer_costs[(a, b)] = additional cost for transfer from a to b
    
    total_sum = 0
    total_cost = 0
    
    for a, b, c in edges:
        total_sum += c
        additional_cost = transfer_costs.get((a, b), 0)
        total_cost += c + additional_cost
    
    return total_sum, total_cost
```

#### 2. **Transfer Speeds Sum with Constraints**
**Variation**: Limited bandwidth, restricted transfers, or specific path requirements.
**Approach**: Use constraint satisfaction with sum calculation.
```python
def constrained_transfer_speeds_sum(n, m, edges, max_bandwidth, restricted_transfers):
    # max_bandwidth = maximum total transfer speed allowed
    # restricted_transfers = set of transfers that cannot be used
    
    total_sum = 0
    used_transfers = []
    
    for a, b, c in edges:
        if (a, b) not in restricted_transfers:
            if total_sum + c <= max_bandwidth:
                total_sum += c
                used_transfers.append((a, b, c))
    
    return total_sum, used_transfers
```

#### 3. **Transfer Speeds Sum with Probabilities**
**Variation**: Each transfer has a probability of being successful.
**Approach**: Use Monte Carlo simulation or expected value calculation.
```python
def probabilistic_transfer_speeds_sum(n, m, edges, transfer_probabilities):
    # transfer_probabilities[(a, b)] = probability transfer from a to b is successful
    
    def monte_carlo_simulation(trials=1000):
        successful_sums = []
        
        for _ in range(trials):
            trial_sum = 0
            for a, b, c in edges:
                if random.random() < transfer_probabilities.get((a, b), 0.5):
                    trial_sum += c
            successful_sums.append(trial_sum)
        
        return sum(successful_sums) / len(successful_sums)
    
    return monte_carlo_simulation()
```

#### 4. **Transfer Speeds Sum with Multiple Criteria**
**Variation**: Optimize for multiple objectives (speed, reliability, efficiency).
**Approach**: Use multi-objective optimization or weighted sum approach.
```python
def multi_criteria_transfer_speeds_sum(n, m, edges, criteria_weights):
    # criteria_weights = {'speed': 0.4, 'reliability': 0.3, 'efficiency': 0.3}
    # Each transfer has multiple attributes
    
    def calculate_transfer_score(transfer_attributes):
        return (criteria_weights['speed'] * transfer_attributes['speed'] + 
                criteria_weights['reliability'] * transfer_attributes['reliability'] + 
                criteria_weights['efficiency'] * transfer_attributes['efficiency'])
    
    total_score = 0
    total_speed = 0
    
    for a, b, c in edges:
        # Calculate transfer attributes (simplified)
        transfer_attrs = {
            'speed': c,
            'reliability': 1.0 - (c / 1000),  # Higher speed = lower reliability
            'efficiency': 100 - c  # Higher speed = lower efficiency
        }
        score = calculate_transfer_score(transfer_attrs)
        total_score += score
        total_speed += c
    
    return total_speed, total_score
```

#### 5. **Transfer Speeds Sum with Dynamic Updates**
**Variation**: Transfers can be added or removed dynamically.
**Approach**: Use dynamic data structures for efficient updates.
```python
class DynamicTransferSpeedsSum:
    def __init__(self):
        self.transfers = []
        self.total_sum = 0
    
    def add_transfer(self, a, b, c):
        self.transfers.append((a, b, c))
        self.total_sum += c
    
    def remove_transfer(self, a, b, c):
        if (a, b, c) in self.transfers:
            self.transfers.remove((a, b, c))
            self.total_sum -= c
    
    def update_transfer_speed(self, a, b, old_c, new_c):
        if (a, b, old_c) in self.transfers:
            self.transfers.remove((a, b, old_c))
            self.transfers.append((a, b, new_c))
            self.total_sum = self.total_sum - old_c + new_c
    
    def get_total_sum(self):
        return self.total_sum
    
    def get_transfers(self):
        return self.transfers
```
