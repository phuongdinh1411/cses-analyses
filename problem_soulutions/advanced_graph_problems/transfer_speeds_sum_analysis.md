## 🔍 Solution Analysis: From Brute Force to Optimal

### Approach 1: Brute Force Solution

**Key Insights from Brute Force Solution**:
- **Exhaustive Search**: Try all possible flow combinations
- **Flow Validation**: Check if each flow combination is valid
- **Cost Calculation**: Calculate total cost for each valid flow
- **Baseline Understanding**: Provides correct answer but highly impractical

**Key Insight**: Try all possible flow combinations and find the one with maximum flow and minimum cost.

**Algorithm**:
- Generate all possible flow combinations
- Check if each combination is valid
- Calculate total cost for valid combinations
- Return the combination with maximum flow and minimum cost

**Visual Example**:
```
Network: 1→2→4, 1→3→4, 2→3, 1→3, 2→4

Flow combinations:
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Combination 1: 1→2→4 (7), 1→3→4 (6) │
│ Flow: 13, Cost: 25 ✓               │
│ Combination 2: 1→2→3→4 (5), 1→3→4 (8) │
│ Flow: 13, Cost: 27 ✗               │
│ ... (other combinations)            │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

### Approach 2: Maximum Flow Solution

**Key Insights from Maximum Flow Solution**:
- **Maximum Flow**: Use Ford-Fulkerson or Edmonds-Karp algorithm
- **Residual Graph**: Build residual graph for flow augmentation
- **Path Finding**: Find augmenting paths using BFS
- **Optimization**: Much more efficient than brute force

**Key Insight**: Use maximum flow algorithms to find the maximum possible flow, then optimize for cost.

**Algorithm**:
- Use Edmonds-Karp algorithm to find maximum flow
- Build residual graph
- Find augmenting paths using BFS
- Calculate total cost

print(f"Maximum flow result: {result}")  # Output: (13, 25)
```

**Time Complexity**: O(n × m²)
**Space Complexity**: O(n²)

**Why it's better**: Much more efficient than brute force, but doesn't optimize for cost.

**Implementation Considerations**:
- **Residual Graph**: Build residual graph for flow augmentation
- **Path Finding**: Use BFS for efficient path finding
- **Flow Updates**: Update flow and residual graph efficiently

**Time Complexity**: O(n² × m²)
**Space Complexity**: O(n²)

**Why it's optimal**: O(n² × m²) time complexity is optimal for minimum cost flow problems.

**Implementation Details**:
- **Maximum Flow**: Use Edmonds-Karp algorithm for maximum flow
- **Cycle Canceling**: Use Bellman-Ford algorithm for negative cycle detection
- **Cost Optimization**: Cancel negative cycles to minimize cost
- **Memory Efficiency**: Use optimal data structures

## 🔧 Implementation Details

| Approach | Time Complexity | Space Complexity | Key Insight |
|----------|----------------|------------------|-------------|
| Brute Force | O(2^m × n) | O(n + m) | Try all possible flow combinations |
| Maximum Flow | O(n × m²) | O(n²) | Use Edmonds-Karp algorithm |
| Minimum Cost Flow | O(n² × m²) | O(n²) | Use cycle-canceling algorithm |

### Time Complexity
- **Time**: O(n² × m²) - Find maximum flow and minimize cost
- **Space**: O(n²) - Store flow and residual graph

### Why This Solution Works
- **Maximum Flow**: Use Edmonds-Karp algorithm for maximum flow
- **Cycle Canceling**: Use Bellman-Ford algorithm for negative cycle detection
- **Cost Optimization**: Cancel negative cycles to minimize cost
- **Optimal Algorithm**: Use cycle-canceling algorithm for efficiency

#### **2. Dynamic Flow Network**
**Problem**: Support adding/removing edges and answering flow queries.
