## 🔍 Solution Analysis: From Brute Force to Optimal

### Approach 1: Brute Force Solution

**Key Insights from Brute Force Solution**:
- **Multiple BFS**: Run BFS from each query node to all shop nodes
- **Exhaustive Search**: Find shortest path to each shop individually
- **Quadratic Complexity**: O(q × k × (n + m)) time complexity
- **Baseline Understanding**: Provides correct answer but highly inefficient

**Key Insight**: For each query, run BFS from the query node to find the shortest distance to each shop.

**Algorithm**:
- For each query node, run BFS to find shortest distances to all nodes
- Find the minimum distance among all shop nodes
- Return the minimum distance

**Visual Example**:
```
Graph: 1-2(2), 2-3(3), 3-4(1), 4-5(2), 1-4(4), 2-5(1)
Shops: {2, 4}

Query from node 1:
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ BFS distances from node 1:          │
│ dist[1] = 0, dist[2] = 2, dist[4] = 4 │
│ Nearest shop: shop 2 at distance 2  │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

Query from node 3:
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ BFS distances from node 3:          │
│ dist[2] = 3, dist[3] = 0, dist[4] = 1 │
│ Nearest shop: shop 4 at distance 1  │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Implementation**:
```python
def brute_force_solution(n, edges, shops, queries):
    """
    Find nearest shops using brute force BFS approach
    
    Args:
        n: number of nodes

    """

        adj[b-1].append((a-1, w))  # Undirected edge
    
    def bfs_from_node(start):
        """Run BFS from start node to find shortest distances"""
        from collections import deque
        
        dist = [float('inf')] * n
        dist[start] = 0
        queue = deque([start])
        
        while queue:
            node = queue.popleft()
            for neighbor, weight in adj[node]:
                if dist[neighbor] > dist[node] + weight:
                    dist[neighbor] = dist[node] + weight
                    queue.append(neighbor)
        
        return dist
    
    # Answer queries
    results = []

        dist = bfs_from_node(query - 1)  # Convert to 0-indexed
        
        # Find nearest shop

        results.append(min_distance)
    
    return results

# Example usage
n = 5
edges = [(1, 2, 2), (2, 3, 3), (3, 4, 1), (4, 5, 2), (1, 4, 4), (2, 5, 1)]

queries = [1, 3, 5]
result = brute_force_solution(n, edges, shops, queries)
print(f"Brute force result: {result}")  # Output: [2, 1, 2]
```

**Time Complexity**: O(q × (n + m))
**Space Complexity**: O(n + m)

**Why it's inefficient**: O(q × (n + m)) time complexity makes it inefficient for large numbers of queries.

### Approach 2: Multi-Source BFS Solution

**Key Insights from Multi-Source BFS Solution**:
- **Multi-Source BFS**: Run BFS from all shop nodes simultaneously
- **Single Pass**: Compute distances to all nodes in one BFS pass
- **Efficient Queries**: Answer queries in O(1) time after preprocessing
- **Optimization**: Much more efficient than brute force for multiple queries

**Key Insight**: Use multi-source BFS to compute shortest distances from all shop nodes to all other nodes in one pass.

**Algorithm**:
- Initialize BFS queue with all shop nodes
- Run BFS to compute shortest distances from any shop to each node
- Answer queries by returning precomputed distances

**Visual Example**:
```
Graph: 1-2(2), 2-3(3), 3-4(1), 4-5(2), 1-4(4), 2-5(1)
Shops: {2, 4}

┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Start: queue = [2, 4]              │
│ Step 1: dist[2] = 0, dist[4] = 0   │
│ Step 2: dist[1] = 2, dist[3] = 1   │
│ Step 3: dist[5] = 2                │
│ Final distances: [2, 0, 1, 0, 2]   │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

Query answers: [2, 1, 2]
```

**Implementation**:

    """

        adj[b-1].append((a-1, w))  # Undirected edge
    
    def multi_source_bfs():
        """Run multi-source BFS from all shop nodes"""
        from collections import deque
        
        dist = [float('inf')] * n
        queue = deque()
        
        # Initialize queue with all shop nodes
        for shop in shops:
            dist[shop - 1] = 0  # Convert to 0-indexed
            queue.append(shop - 1)
        
        # Run BFS
        while queue:
            node = queue.popleft()
            for neighbor, weight in adj[node]:
                if dist[neighbor] > dist[node] + weight:
                    dist[neighbor] = dist[node] + weight
                    queue.append(neighbor)
        
        return dist
    
    # Precompute distances
    dist = multi_source_bfs()
    
    # Answer queries
    results = []
    for query in queries:
        results.append(dist[query - 1])  # Convert to 0-indexed
    
    return results

# Example usage
n = 5
edges = [(1, 2, 2), (2, 3, 3), (3, 4, 1), (4, 5, 2), (1, 4, 4), (2, 5, 1)]
shops = [2, 4]
queries = [1, 3, 5]
result = multi_source_bfs_solution(n, edges, shops, queries)
print(f"Multi-source BFS result: {result}")  # Output: [2, 1, 2]
```

**Time Complexity**: O(n + m + q)
**Space Complexity**: O(n + m)

**Why it's better**: O(n + m) preprocessing time and O(1) per query, making it much more efficient for multiple queries.

**Implementation Considerations**:
- **Multi-Source Initialization**: Initialize BFS queue with all shop nodes
- **Distance Updates**: Update distances efficiently during BFS
- **Memory Management**: Use single distance array for all nodes

### Approach 3: Dijkstra's Algorithm Solution (Optimal)

**Key Insights from Dijkstra's Algorithm Solution**:
- **Priority Queue**: Use priority queue for efficient shortest path computation
- **Weighted Graphs**: Handle weighted edges correctly
- **Optimal Complexity**: O((n + m) log n) time complexity
- **Efficient Implementation**: Best approach for weighted graphs

**Key Insight**: Use Dijkstra's algorithm with multi-source initialization to compute shortest distances from all shop nodes.

**Algorithm**:
- Initialize priority queue with all shop nodes at distance 0
- Run Dijkstra's algorithm to compute shortest distances
- Answer queries by returning precomputed distances

**Visual Example**:
```
Graph: 1-2(2), 2-3(3), 3-4(1), 4-5(2), 1-4(4), 2-5(1)
Shops: {2, 4}

Dijkstra's algorithm:
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Start: pq = [(0, 2), (0, 4)]       │
│ Step 1: dist[2] = 0, dist[4] = 0   │
│ Step 2: dist[1] = 2, dist[3] = 1   │
│ Step 3: dist[5] = 2                │
│ Final distances: [2, 0, 1, 0, 2]   │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

Query answers: [2, 1, 2]
```

**Implementation**:

queries = [1, 3, 5]
result = dijkstra_solution(n, edges, shops, queries)
print(f"Dijkstra result: {result}")  # Output: [2, 1, 2]
```

**Time Complexity**: O((n + m) log n + q)
**Space Complexity**: O(n + m)

**Why it's optimal**: O((n + m) log n) preprocessing time and O(1) per query, optimal for weighted graphs.

**Implementation Details**:
- **Priority Queue**: Use heapq for efficient priority queue operations
- **Multi-Source Initialization**: Initialize with all shop nodes
- **Distance Updates**: Update distances efficiently during algorithm
- **Memory Efficiency**: Use single distance array

## 🔧 Implementation Details

| Approach | Time Complexity | Space Complexity | Key Insight |
|----------|----------------|------------------|-------------|
| Brute Force | O(q × (n + m)) | O(n + m) | Run BFS for each query |
| Multi-Source BFS | O(n + m + q) | O(n + m) | Run BFS from all shops once |
| Dijkstra's Algorithm | O((n + m) log n + q) | O(n + m) | Use priority queue for weighted graphs |

### Time Complexity
- **Time**: O((n + m) log n + q) - Precompute distances, then O(1) per query
- **Space**: O(n + m) - Store graph and distance information

### Why This Solution Works
- **Multi-Source Shortest Path**: Compute shortest distances from all shop nodes efficiently
- **Priority Queue**: Use priority queue for optimal shortest path computation
- **Query Optimization**: Answer queries in constant time after preprocessing
- **Memory Efficiency**: Store only necessary distance information

## 🚀 Problem Variations

### Extended Problems with Detailed Code Examples

#### **1. Dynamic Nearest Shops**
**Problem**: Support adding/removing shops and answering nearest shop queries.

**Key Differences**: Shop set can change dynamically

**Solution Approach**: Use dynamic graph analysis with incremental updates

**Implementation**:
```python
class DynamicNearestShops:
    def __init__(self, n, edges):
        self.n = n
        self.edges = edges
        self.shops = set()
        self.adj = [[] for _ in range(n)]
        self.dist_cache = None
        
        # Build adjacency list
        for a, b, w in edges:
            self.adj[a-1].append((b-1, w))  # Convert to 0-indexed
            self.adj[b-1].append((a-1, w))  # Undirected edge
    
    def add_shop(self, shop):
        """Add a shop to the set"""
        if shop not in self.shops:
            self.shops.add(shop)
            self.dist_cache = None  # Invalidate cache
    
    def remove_shop(self, shop):
        """Remove a shop from the set"""

    def get_nearest_shop_distance(self, query):
        """Get distance to nearest shop"""
        if not self.shops:
            return float('inf')
        
        if self.dist_cache is None:
            self._compute_distances()
        
        return self.dist_cache[query - 1]  # Convert to 0-indexed
    
    def _compute_distances(self):
        """Compute distances to nearest shops"""
        import heapq
        
        dist = [float('inf')] * self.n
        pq = []
        
        # Initialize priority queue with all shop nodes
        for shop in self.shops:
            dist[shop - 1] = 0  # Convert to 0-indexed
            heapq.heappush(pq, (0, shop - 1))
        
        # Run Dijkstra's algorithm
        while pq:
            d, node = heapq.heappop(pq)
            if d > dist[node]:
                continue  # Skip if we've found a better path
            
            for neighbor, weight in self.adj[node]:
                if dist[neighbor] > dist[node] + weight:
                    dist[neighbor] = dist[node] + weight
                    heapq.heappush(pq, (dist[neighbor], neighbor))
        
        self.dist_cache = dist

# Example usage
dns = DynamicNearestShops(5, [(1, 2, 2), (2, 3, 3), (3, 4, 1), (4, 5, 2), (1, 4, 4), (2, 5, 1)])
dns.add_shop(2)
dns.add_shop(4)
result1 = dns.get_nearest_shop_distance(1)
print(f"Dynamic nearest shops result: {result1}")
```

#### **2. K-Nearest Shops**
**Problem**: Find the k nearest shops to a given node.

**Key Differences**: Return multiple nearest shops instead of just one

**Solution Approach**: Use modified Dijkstra's algorithm to find k nearest shops

**Implementation**:
```python
def k_nearest_shops(n, edges, shops, queries, k):
    """
    Find k nearest shops to each query node
    
    Args:

        dist[query - 1] = 0
        
        nearest_shops = []
        
        while pq and len(nearest_shops) < k:
            d, node = heapq.heappop(pq)
            if d > dist[node]:
                continue  # Skip if we've found a better path
            
            # Check if this node is a shop
            if node + 1 in shops:  # Convert back to 1-indexed
                nearest_shops.append(d)
            
            for neighbor, weight in adj[node]:
                if dist[neighbor] > dist[node] + weight:

    for query in queries:
        k_nearest = find_k_nearest_shops(query)
        results.append(k_nearest)
    
    return results

# Example usage
n = 5
edges = [(1, 2, 2), (2, 3, 3), (3, 4, 1), (4, 5, 2), (1, 4, 4), (2, 5, 1)]
shops = [2, 4]
queries = [1, 3, 5]
k = 2
result = k_nearest_shops(n, edges, shops, queries, k)
print(f"K-nearest shops result: {result}")
```

#### **3. Nearest Shops with Constraints**
**Problem**: Find nearest shops with additional constraints (e.g., shop type, capacity).

**Key Differences**: Consider additional constraints when finding nearest shops

**Solution Approach**: Use modified Dijkstra's algorithm with constraint checking

**Implementation**:
```python

        adj[b-1].append((a-1, w))  # Undirected edge
    
    def find_nearest_shop_of_type(query):
        """Find nearest shop of required type to query node"""

## Problem Variations

### **Variation 3: Nearest Shops with Constraints**
**Problem**: Handle nearest shop calculation with additional constraints (distance limits, shop constraints, pattern constraints).

**Approach**: Use constraint satisfaction with advanced optimization and mathematical analysis.
