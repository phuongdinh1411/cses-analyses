# Prufer Code

## Problem Description

**Problem**: Given a tree with n vertices, find its Prufer code. The Prufer code is a unique sequence that represents a labeled tree.

**Input**: 
- n: number of vertices
- n-1 edges: a b (edge between vertices a and b)

**Output**: Prufer code of the tree.

**Example**:
```
Input:
4
1 2
2 3
3 4

Output:
2 3

Explanation: 
The Prufer code [2, 3] represents the tree:
1 -- 2 -- 3 -- 4
```

## 🎯 Solution Progression

### Step 1: Understanding the Problem
**What are we trying to do?**
- Find Prufer code of a labeled tree
- Use tree properties and algorithms
- Understand Prufer code construction
- Apply graph theory concepts

**Key Observations:**
- Prufer code has length n-2
- Each step removes a leaf vertex
- Code records the neighbor of removed leaf
- Unique representation of labeled trees

### Step 2: Prufer Code Construction
**Idea**: Iteratively remove leaves and record their neighbors.

```python
def prufer_code_construction(n, edges):
    # Build adjacency list
    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for a, b in edges:
        adj[a].append(b)
        adj[b].append(a)
    
    # Count degrees
    degree = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        degree[i] = len(adj[i])
    
    # Find Prufer code
    prufer = []
    for _ in range(n - 2):
        # Find leaf with smallest label
        leaf = 1
        while degree[leaf] != 1:
            leaf += 1
        
        # Find its neighbor
        neighbor = adj[leaf][0]
        prufer.append(neighbor)
        
        # Remove the leaf
        degree[leaf] = 0
        degree[neighbor] -= 1
        adj[neighbor].remove(leaf)
    
    return prufer
```

**Why this works:**
- Follows Prufer code algorithm
- Removes leaves iteratively
- Records neighbors in sequence
- O(n²) time complexity

### Step 3: Complete Solution
**Putting it all together:**

```python
def solve_prufer_code():
    n = int(input())
    edges = []
    
    for _ in range(n - 1):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        edges.append((a, b))
    
    # Build adjacency list
    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for a, b in edges:
        adj[a].append(b)
        adj[b].append(a)
    
    # Count degrees
    degree = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        degree[i] = len(adj[i])
    
    # Find Prufer code
    prufer = []
    for _ in range(n - 2):
        # Find leaf with smallest label
        leaf = 1
        while degree[leaf] != 1:
            leaf += 1
        
        # Find its neighbor
        neighbor = adj[leaf][0]
        prufer.append(neighbor)
        
        # Remove the leaf
        degree[leaf] = 0
        degree[neighbor] -= 1
        adj[neighbor].remove(leaf)
    
    print(*prufer)

# Main execution
if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve_prufer_code()
```

**Why this works:**
- Optimal Prufer code construction
- Handles all edge cases
- Efficient implementation

**Putting it all together:**

```python
def solve_prufer_code():
    n = int(input())
    edges = []
    
    for _ in range(n - 1):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        edges.append((a, b))
    
    # Build adjacency list
    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for a, b in edges:
        adj[a].append(b)
        adj[b].append(a)
    
    # Count degrees
    degree = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        degree[i] = len(adj[i])
    
    # Use priority queue for leaves
    from heapq import heappush, heappop
    leaves = []
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if degree[i] == 1:
            heappush(leaves, i)
    
    # Find Prufer code
    prufer = []
    for _ in range(n - 2):
        # Get smallest leaf
        leaf = heappop(leaves)
        
        # Find its neighbor
        neighbor = adj[leaf][0]
        prufer.append(neighbor)
        
        # Remove the leaf
        degree[leaf] = 0
        degree[neighbor] -= 1
        adj[neighbor].remove(leaf)
        
        # Add neighbor to leaves if it becomes a leaf
        if degree[neighbor] == 1:
            heappush(leaves, neighbor)
    
    print(*prufer)

    test_cases = [
        (4, [(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4)], [2, 3]),
        (3, [(1, 2), (2, 3)], [2]),
        (5, [(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5)], [2, 3, 4]),
    ]
    
    for n, edges, expected in test_cases:
        result = solve_test(n, edges)

    degree = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        degree[i] = len(adj[i])
    
    # Use priority queue for leaves

    # Find Prufer code
    prufer = []
    for _ in range(n - 2):

        # Remove the leaf
        degree[leaf] = 0
        degree[neighbor] -= 1
        adj[neighbor].remove(leaf)
        
        # Add neighbor to leaves if it becomes a leaf

## 🎯 Problem Variations

### Variation 1: Tree Reconstruction from Prufer Code
**Problem**: Given a Prufer code, reconstruct the original tree.

```python
def reconstruct_tree_from_prufer(n, prufer):
    # Initialize degree array
    degree = [1] * (n + 1)
    for code in prufer:
        degree[code] += 1
    
    # Find missing vertices
    missing = []
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if degree[i] == 1:
            missing.append(i)
    
    # Reconstruct tree
    edges = []
    for code in prufer:
        # Find smallest missing vertex
        leaf = min(missing)
        missing.remove(leaf)
        
        # Add edge
        edges.append((code, leaf))
        
        # Update degrees
        degree[code] -= 1
        if degree[code] == 1:
            missing.append(code)
    
    # Add final edge
    if len(missing) == 2:
        edges.append((missing[0], missing[1]))
    
    return edges
```

### Variation 2: Prufer Code with Weights
**Problem**: Each edge has a weight. Find Prufer code and total weight.

```python
def prufer_code_with_weights(n, edges, weights):
    # Build adjacency list with weights
    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for i, (a, b) in enumerate(edges):
        adj[a].append((b, weights[i]))
        adj[b].append((a, weights[i]))
    
    # Count degrees
    degree = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        degree[i] = len(adj[i])
    
    # Use priority queue for leaves
    from heapq import heappush, heappop
    leaves = []
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if degree[i] == 1:
            heappush(leaves, i)
    
    # Find Prufer code and total weight
    prufer = []
    total_weight = 0
    
    for _ in range(n - 2):
        # Get smallest leaf
        leaf = heappop(leaves)
        
        # Find its neighbor and weight
        neighbor, weight = adj[leaf][0]
        prufer.append(neighbor)
        total_weight += weight
        
        # Remove the leaf
        degree[leaf] = 0
        degree[neighbor] -= 1
        adj[neighbor].remove((leaf, weight))
        
        # Add neighbor to leaves if it becomes a leaf
        if degree[neighbor] == 1:
            heappush(leaves, neighbor)
    
    return prufer, total_weight
```

### Variation 3: Prufer Code for Forests
**Problem**: Handle multiple trees (forest) and find Prufer codes.

```python
def prufer_code_forest(n, edges):
    # Build adjacency list
    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for a, b in edges:
        adj[a].append(b)
        adj[b].append(a)
    
    # Find connected components
    visited = [False] * (n + 1)
    components = []
    
    def dfs(node, component):
        visited[node] = True
        component.append(node)
        for neighbor in adj[node]:
            if not visited[neighbor]:
                dfs(neighbor, component)
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if not visited[i]:
            component = []
            dfs(i, component)
            components.append(component)
    
    # Find Prufer code for each component
    all_prufer_codes = []
    for component in components:
        if len(component) > 1:
            # Create subgraph for this component
            component_edges = []
            for a, b in edges:
                if a in component and b in component:
                    component_edges.append((a, b))
            
            # Find Prufer code for this component
            prufer = prufer_code_for_component(component, component_edges)
            all_prufer_codes.append(prufer)
    
    return all_prufer_codes

def prufer_code_for_component(component, edges):
    # Similar to main algorithm but for a specific component
    # Implementation details...
    pass
```

### Variation 4: Prufer Code with Constraints
**Problem**: Find Prufer code while respecting certain constraints.

```python
def prufer_code_constrained(n, edges, constraints):
    # constraints: set of forbidden edges
    # Build adjacency list
    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for a, b in edges:
        if (a, b) not in constraints and (b, a) not in constraints:
            adj[a].append(b)
            adj[b].append(a)
    
    # Count degrees
    degree = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        degree[i] = len(adj[i])
    
    # Use priority queue for leaves
    from heapq import heappush, heappop
    leaves = []
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if degree[i] == 1:
            heappush(leaves, i)
    
    # Find Prufer code
    prufer = []
    for _ in range(n - 2):
        # Get smallest leaf
        leaf = heappop(leaves)
        
        # Find its neighbor
        neighbor = adj[leaf][0]
        prufer.append(neighbor)
        
        # Remove the leaf
        degree[leaf] = 0
        degree[neighbor] -= 1
        adj[neighbor].remove(leaf)
        
        # Add neighbor to leaves if it becomes a leaf
        if degree[neighbor] == 1:
            heappush(leaves, neighbor)
    
    return prufer
```

### Variation 5: Prufer Code Enumeration
**Problem**: Count all possible Prufer codes for a given tree structure.

```python
def count_prufer_codes(n, tree_structure):
    # tree_structure: describes the tree topology
    # For labeled trees, number of Prufer codes = n!
    # For unlabeled trees, need to consider symmetries
    
    # For labeled trees
    if tree_structure == "labeled":
        from math import factorial
        return factorial(n)
    
    # For unlabeled trees, more complex
    # Would need to consider automorphisms
    return "Complex calculation needed"
```
