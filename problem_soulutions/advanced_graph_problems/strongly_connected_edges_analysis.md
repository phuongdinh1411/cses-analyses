## 📋 Problem Description

Given a directed graph, find the minimum number of edges to add to make it strongly connected.

**Input**: 
- n: number of vertices
- m: number of edges
- m lines: a b (edge from vertex a to vertex b)

**Output**: 
- Minimum number of edges to add

**Constraints**:
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
- 0 ≤ m ≤ 10^5
- 1 ≤ a,b ≤ n

**Example**:
```
Input:
4 3
1 2
2 3
3 4

Output:
1

Explanation**: 
Add edge (4, 1) to make the graph strongly connected.
Current: 1→2→3→4 (no path back from 4 to 1)
After adding (4,1): 1→2→3→4→1 (strongly connected)
```

### 📊 Visual Example

**Input Graph:**
```
    1 ──→ 2 ──→ 3 ──→ 4
```

**Strongly Connected Components (SCCs):**
```
SCC 1: {1}
SCC 2: {2}
SCC 3: {3}
SCC 4: {4}

Each vertex is its own SCC (no cycles)
```

**Condensation Graph:**
```
SCC1 ──→ SCC2 ──→ SCC3 ──→ SCC4
```

**Strong Connectivity Analysis:**
```
Current State:
- 4 separate SCCs
- No path from SCC4 back to SCC1
- Graph is not strongly connected

Required:
- Add edge from SCC4 to SCC1: 4 → 1
- This creates a cycle: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1
- All vertices become reachable from each other
```

**Solution: Add Edge (4, 1)**
```
After adding edge (4, 1):
    1 ──→ 2 ──→ 3 ──→ 4
    ↑                   │
    └───────────────────┘

New SCCs:
SCC 1: {1, 2, 3, 4} (all vertices strongly connected)

Strong connectivity achieved with 1 edge!
```

**Algorithm Visualization:**
```
Step 1: Find SCCs using Kosaraju's algorithm
SCCs: {1}, {2}, {3}, {4}

Step 2: Build condensation graph
Nodes: {SCC1, SCC2, SCC3, SCC4}
Edges: {(SCC1, SCC2), (SCC2, SCC3), (SCC3, SCC4)}

Step 3: Count sources and sinks
Sources: 1 (SCC1)
Sinks: 1 (SCC4)

Step 4: Calculate minimum edges
min_edges = max(sources, sinks) = max(1, 1) = 1
```

**General Formula:**
```
For strongly connected graph:
min_edges = max(sources, sinks)

Where:
- sources = SCCs with in-degree 0
- sinks = SCCs with out-degree 0
```

## 🔍 Solution Analysis: From Brute Force to Optimal

### Approach 1: Brute Force Edge Addition (Brute Force)

**Key Insights from Brute Force Approach**:
- **SCC Analysis**: Find all strongly connected components
- **Connectivity Check**: Check if graph is already strongly connected
- **Edge Addition**: Try adding edges between different SCCs
- **Exhaustive Search**: Try all possible edge combinations

**Key Insight**: Use brute force to try all possible edge additions until the graph becomes strongly connected.

**Algorithm**:
- Find all strongly connected components using DFS
- Check if graph is already strongly connected
- Try adding edges between different SCCs
- Count minimum edges needed

**Visual Example**:
```
Graph: 1→2→3→4

Step 1: Find SCCs
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ SCC 1: {1}                         │
│ SCC 2: {2}                         │
│ SCC 3: {3}                         │
│ SCC 4: {4}                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

Step 2: Try adding edges
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Add (4,1): Creates cycle 1→2→3→4→1 │
│ All vertices reachable from each    │
│ other ✓                            │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

Result: 1 edge needed
```

**Time Complexity**: O(n² * (n + m))
**Space Complexity**: O(n + m)

**Why it's inefficient**: O(n² * (n + m)) complexity is too slow for large graphs.

- **Condensation Graph**: Build graph of SCCs
- **Source/Sink Count**: Count in-degree and out-degree
- **Mathematical Formula**: Use max(sources, sinks)

### Approach 3: Optimal SCC Analysis (Optimal)

**Key Insights from Optimal SCC Analysis**:
- **SCC Properties**: Leverage strongly connected component properties
- **Condensation Graph**: Use condensation graph for analysis
- **Mathematical Formula**: min_edges = max(sources, sinks) is mathematically proven
- **Optimal Algorithm**: Kosaraju's or Tarjan's algorithm for SCC finding

**Key Insight**: Use the mathematical property that minimum edges needed equals the maximum of sources and sinks in the condensation graph.

**Algorithm**:
- Find all strongly connected components
- Build condensation graph
- Count sources (in-degree 0) and sinks (out-degree 0)
- Return max(sources, sinks)

**Visual Example**:
```
Graph: 1→2→3→4

Optimal Analysis:
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ SCCs: {1}, {2}, {3}, {4}          │

│ min_edges = max(1, 1) = 1          │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

- Each source needs an incoming edge
- Each sink needs an outgoing edge
- Minimum edges = max(sources, sinks)
