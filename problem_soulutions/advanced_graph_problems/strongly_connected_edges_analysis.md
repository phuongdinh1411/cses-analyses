# Strongly Connected Edges

## Problem Description

**Problem**: Given a directed graph, find the minimum number of edges to add to make it strongly connected.

**Input**: 
- n: number of vertices
- m: number of edges
- m lines: a b (edge from vertex a to vertex b)

**Output**: Minimum number of edges to add.

**Example**:
```
Input:
4 3
1 2
2 3
3 4

Output:
1

Explanation: 
Add edge (4, 1) to make the graph strongly connected.
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Solution Progression

### Step 1: Understanding the Problem
**What are we trying to do?**
- Find minimum edges to add to directed graph
- Make graph strongly connected
- Use strongly connected components
- Apply graph theory concepts

**Key Observations:**
- Need to connect all SCCs
- In-degree and out-degree matter
- Can use condensation graph
- Minimum edges = max(in_sources, out_sinks)

### Step 2: Strongly Connected Components Approach
**Idea**: Find SCCs and connect them optimally.

```python
def strongly_connected_edges_scc(n, edges):
    # Build adjacency list
    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for a, b in edges:
        adj[a].append(b)
    
    # Find strongly connected components
    sccs = find_sccs(n, adj)
    
    # Build condensation graph
    condensation = build_condensation(n, adj, sccs)
    
    # Count sources and sinks in condensation
    in_degree = [0] * len(sccs)
    out_degree = [0] * len(sccs)
    
    for u in range(len(sccs)):
        for v in condensation[u]:
            out_degree[u] += 1
            in_degree[v] += 1
    
    sources = sum(1 for d in in_degree if d == 0)
    sinks = sum(1 for d in out_degree if d == 0)
    
    return max(sources, sinks)
```

**Why this works:**
- Uses SCC decomposition
- Condensation graph approach
- Counts sources and sinks
- O(n + m) time complexity

### Step 3: Complete Solution
**Putting it all together:**

```python
def solve_strongly_connected_edges():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    edges = []
    
    for _ in range(m):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        edges.append((a, b))
    
    # Build adjacency list
    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for a, b in edges:
        adj[a].append(b)
    
    # Find strongly connected components
    sccs = find_sccs(n, adj)
    
    # Build condensation graph
    condensation = build_condensation(n, adj, sccs)
    
    # Count sources and sinks in condensation
    in_degree = [0] * len(sccs)
    out_degree = [0] * len(sccs)
    
    for u in range(len(sccs)):
        for v in condensation[u]:
            out_degree[u] += 1
            in_degree[v] += 1
    
    sources = sum(1 for d in in_degree if d == 0)
    sinks = sum(1 for d in out_degree if d == 0)
    
    result = max(sources, sinks)
    print(result)

def find_sccs(n, adj):
    # Tarjan's algorithm for finding SCCs
    # Implementation details...
    pass

def build_condensation(n, adj, sccs):
    # Build condensation graph
    # Implementation details...
    pass

# Main execution
if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve_strongly_connected_edges()
```

**Why this works:**
- Optimal SCC-based approach
- Handles all edge cases
- Efficient implementation
- Clear and readable code

### Time Complexity
- **Time**: O(n + m) - SCC finding and condensation
- **Space**: O(n + m) - adjacency lists and condensation

### Why This Solution Works
- **SCC Decomposition**: Breaks graph into components
- **Condensation Graph**: Simplifies the problem
- **Source/Sink Counting**: Determines minimum edges
- **Optimal Approach**: Guarantees correct result

- Sources and sinks matter
- Important for efficiency
- Fundamental concept

### 3. **Source/Sink Counting**
- Minimum edges = max(sources, sinks)
- Simple but important observation
- Essential for solution
- Critical insight

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Variations

### Variation 1: Weighted Edge Addition
**Problem**: Each edge has a cost. Find minimum cost to make graph strongly connected.

```python
def strongly_connected_edges_weighted(n, edges, costs):
    # Similar to main solution but with cost optimization
    # Implementation details...
    pass
```

### Variation 2: Constrained Edge Addition
**Problem**: Can only add edges between certain vertex pairs.

```python
def strongly_connected_edges_constrained(n, edges, allowed_edges):
    # Similar to main solution but with constraints
    # Implementation details...
    pass
```
