# Fixed Length Hamiltonian Path Queries II

## Problem Description

**Problem**: Given a graph, answer queries about Hamiltonian paths (paths visiting each vertex exactly once) of fixed length with additional constraints.

**Input**: 
- n, m: number of vertices and edges
- m lines: a b (edge between vertices a and b)
- q: number of queries
- q lines: u v k (query: is there a Hamiltonian path of length k from u to v?)

**Output**: For each query, print "YES" if Hamiltonian path exists, "NO" otherwise.

**Example**:
```
Input:
4 4
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 1
3
1 4 3
1 4 4
2 3 2

Output:
NO
YES
NO

Explanation: 
No Hamiltonian path of length 3 from 1 to 4
Hamiltonian path 1→2→3→4 has length 4 from 1 to 4
No Hamiltonian path of length 2 from 2 to 3
```

## 🎯 Solution Progression

### Step 1: Understanding the Problem
**What are we trying to do?**
- Find Hamiltonian paths of specific lengths
- Use graph algorithms and dynamic programming
- Handle multiple queries efficiently
- Apply constraint satisfaction concepts

**Key Observations:**
- This is a Hamiltonian path problem
- Can use dynamic programming with bitmasking
- Hamiltonian paths must visit each vertex exactly once
- State representation is crucial

### Step 2: Dynamic Programming with Bitmasking
**Idea**: Use DP with bitmask to track visited vertices.

```python
def hamiltonian_path_queries_dp(n, edges, queries):
    # Build adjacency list
    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for a, b in edges:
        adj[a].append(b)
        adj[b].append(a)
    
    # DP with bitmask
    def has_hamiltonian_path(start, end, length):
        # dp[mask][pos] = can we reach pos with visited vertices in mask
        dp = [[False] * (n + 1) for _ in range(1 << n)]
        
        # Base case: start position
        dp[1 << (start - 1)][start] = True
        
        # Try all possible masks
        for mask in range(1 << n):
            for pos in range(1, n + 1):
                if not dp[mask][pos]:
                    continue
                
                # Try all neighbors
                for neighbor in adj[pos]:
                    if mask & (1 << (neighbor - 1)) == 0:  # Not visited
                        new_mask = mask | (1 << (neighbor - 1))
                        dp[new_mask][neighbor] = True
        
        # Check if we can reach end with exactly length vertices
        for mask in range(1 << n):
            if bin(mask).count('1') == length and dp[mask][end]:
                return True
        
        return False
    
    # Answer queries
    results = []
    for u, v, k in queries:
        if has_hamiltonian_path(u, v, k):
            results.append("YES")
        else:
            results.append("NO")
    
    return results
```

**Why this works:**
- Uses dynamic programming with bitmasking
- Handles Hamiltonian path constraints
- Efficient implementation
- O(2^n * n * m) time complexity

        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        edges.append((a, b))
    
    q = int(input())
    queries = []
    for _ in range(q):
        u, v, k = map(int, input().split())
        queries.append((u, v, k))
    
    # Build adjacency list
    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for a, b in edges:
        adj[a].append(b)
        adj[b].append(a)
    
    # DP with bitmask
    def has_hamiltonian_path(start, end, length):
        # dp[mask][pos] = can we reach pos with visited vertices in mask
        dp = [[False] * (n + 1) for _ in range(1 << n)]
        
        # Base case: start position
        dp[1 << (start - 1)][start] = True
        
        # Try all possible masks
        for mask in range(1 << n):
            for pos in range(1, n + 1):
                if not dp[mask][pos]:
                    continue
                
                # Try all neighbors
                for neighbor in adj[pos]:
                    if mask & (1 << (neighbor - 1)) == 0:  # Not visited
                        new_mask = mask | (1 << (neighbor - 1))
                        dp[new_mask][neighbor] = True
        
        # Check if we can reach end with exactly length vertices
        for mask in range(1 << n):
            if bin(mask).count('1') == length and dp[mask][end]:
                return True
        
        return False
    
    # Answer queries
    for u, v, k in queries:
        if has_hamiltonian_path(u, v, k):
            print("YES")
        else:
            print("NO")

# Main execution
if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve_fixed_length_hamiltonian_path_queries_ii()

        adj[a].append(b)
        adj[b].append(a)
    
    # DP with bitmask
    def has_hamiltonian_path(start, end, length):

                    if mask & (1 << (neighbor - 1)) == 0:  # Not visited
                        new_mask = mask | (1 << (neighbor - 1))
                        dp[new_mask][neighbor] = True

## 🎯 Problem Variations

### Variation 1: Hamiltonian Paths with Weights

```python
def weighted_hamiltonian_path_queries(n, edges, queries, weights):
    # Build adjacency list with weights
    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for a, b in edges:
        weight = weights.get((a, b), 1)
        adj[a].append((b, weight))
        adj[b].append((a, weight))
    
    def min_weight_hamiltonian_path(start, end, length):
        # dp[mask][pos] = minimum weight to reach pos with visited vertices in mask
        dp = [[float('inf')] * (n + 1) for _ in range(1 << n)]
        
        # Base case: start position
        dp[1 << (start - 1)][start] = 0
        
        # Try all possible masks
        for mask in range(1 << n):
            for pos in range(1, n + 1):
                if dp[mask][pos] == float('inf'):
                    continue
                
                # Try all neighbors
                for neighbor, weight in adj[pos]:
                    if mask & (1 << (neighbor - 1)) == 0:  # Not visited
                        new_mask = mask | (1 << (neighbor - 1))
                        dp[new_mask][neighbor] = min(dp[new_mask][neighbor], 
                                                   dp[mask][pos] + weight)
        
        # Check if we can reach end with exactly length vertices
        min_weight = float('inf')
        for mask in range(1 << n):
            if bin(mask).count('1') == length and dp[mask][end] != float('inf'):
                min_weight = min(min_weight, dp[mask][end])
        
        return min_weight if min_weight != float('inf') else -1
    
    # Answer queries
    results = []
    for u, v, k in queries:
        weight = min_weight_hamiltonian_path(u, v, k)
        results.append(weight)
    
    return results
```

### Variation 2: Hamiltonian Paths with Constraints
**Problem**: Find Hamiltonian paths avoiding certain edges.

```python
def constrained_hamiltonian_path_queries(n, edges, queries, forbidden_edges):
    # Build adjacency list excluding forbidden edges
    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for a, b in edges:
        if (a, b) not in forbidden_edges and (b, a) not in forbidden_edges:
            adj[a].append(b)
            adj[b].append(a)
    
    def has_hamiltonian_path(start, end, length):
        # dp[mask][pos] = can we reach pos with visited vertices in mask
        dp = [[False] * (n + 1) for _ in range(1 << n)]
        
        # Base case: start position
        dp[1 << (start - 1)][start] = True
        
        # Try all possible masks
        for mask in range(1 << n):
            for pos in range(1, n + 1):
                if not dp[mask][pos]:
                    continue
                
                # Try all neighbors
                for neighbor in adj[pos]:
                    if mask & (1 << (neighbor - 1)) == 0:  # Not visited
                        new_mask = mask | (1 << (neighbor - 1))
                        dp[new_mask][neighbor] = True
        
        # Check if we can reach end with exactly length vertices
        for mask in range(1 << n):
            if bin(mask).count('1') == length and dp[mask][end]:
                return True
        
        return False
    
    # Answer queries

            results.append("YES")
        else:
            results.append("NO")
    
    return results
```

### Variation 3: Dynamic Hamiltonian Paths
**Problem**: Support adding/removing edges and maintaining path existence.

```python
class DynamicHamiltonianPathQueries:
    def __init__(self, n):
        self.n = n
        self.adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
        self.edges = set()
    
    def add_edge(self, a, b):
        if (a, b) not in self.edges and (b, a) not in self.edges:
            self.edges.add((a, b))
            self.adj[a].append(b)
            self.adj[b].append(a)
    
    def remove_edge(self, a, b):
        if (a, b) in self.edges:
            self.edges.remove((a, b))
            self.adj[a].remove(b)
            self.adj[b].remove(a)
            return True
        elif (b, a) in self.edges:
            self.edges.remove((b, a))
            self.adj[a].remove(b)
            self.adj[b].remove(a)
            return True
        return False
    
    def has_hamiltonian_path(self, start, end, length):
        # dp[mask][pos] = can we reach pos with visited vertices in mask
        dp = [[False] * (self.n + 1) for _ in range(1 << self.n)]
        
        # Base case: start position
        dp[1 << (start - 1)][start] = True
        
        # Try all possible masks
        for mask in range(1 << self.n):
            for pos in range(1, self.n + 1):
                if not dp[mask][pos]:
                    continue
                
                # Try all neighbors
                for neighbor in self.adj[pos]:
                    if mask & (1 << (neighbor - 1)) == 0:  # Not visited

                return True
        
        return False
```

### Variation 4: Hamiltonian Paths with Multiple Constraints
**Problem**: Find Hamiltonian paths satisfying multiple constraints.

```python
def multi_constrained_hamiltonian_path_queries(n, edges, queries, constraints):
    # Apply multiple constraints
    forbidden_edges = constraints.get('forbidden_edges', set())
    required_edges = constraints.get('required_edges', set())
    
    # Build adjacency list
    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for a, b in edges:
        if (a, b) not in forbidden_edges and (b, a) not in forbidden_edges:
            adj[a].append(b)
            adj[b].append(a)
    
    # Add required edges
    for a, b in required_edges:
        if b not in adj[a]:
            adj[a].append(b)
        if a not in adj[b]:
            adj[b].append(a)
    
    def has_hamiltonian_path(start, end, length):

            results.append("YES")
        else:
            results.append("NO")
    
    return results
```

### Variation 5: Hamiltonian Paths with Edge Replacement
**Problem**: Allow replacing existing edges with new ones.

```python
def edge_replacement_hamiltonian_path_queries(n, edges, queries, replacement_edges):
    def has_hamiltonian_path_with_edges(start, end, length, edge_set):
        # Build adjacency list
        adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
        for a, b in edge_set:
            adj[a].append(b)
            adj[b].append(a)
        
        # dp[mask][pos] = can we reach pos with visited vertices in mask
        dp = [[False] * (n + 1) for _ in range(1 << n)]

                return True
        
        return False
    
    # Try different edge replacements
    best_results = []
    for u, v, k in queries:
        best_has_path = False
        
        # Try original edges
        if has_hamiltonian_path_with_edges(u, v, k, edges):
            best_has_path = True
        
        # Try each replacement
        for old_edge, new_edge in replacement_edges:

## 🎯 Problem Variations

### Variation 1: Weighted Hamiltonian Paths
**Problem**: Each edge has a weight. Find Hamiltonian paths with specific total weight.

```python
def weighted_hamiltonian_path_queries(n, edges, weights, queries):
    # Build weighted adjacency list
    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for i, (a, b) in enumerate(edges):
        adj[a].append((b, weights[i]))
        adj[b].append((a, weights[i]))
    
    def has_weighted_hamiltonian_path(start, end, length, target_weight):
        dp = [[False] * (n + 1) for _ in range(1 << n)]
        weight_dp = [[float('inf')] * (n + 1) for _ in range(1 << n)]
        
        dp[1 << (start - 1)][start] = True
        weight_dp[1 << (start - 1)][start] = 0
        
        for mask in range(1 << n):
            for pos in range(1, n + 1):
                if not dp[mask][pos]:
                    continue
                
                for neighbor, weight in adj[pos]:
                    if mask & (1 << (neighbor - 1)) == 0:
                        new_mask = mask | (1 << (neighbor - 1))
                        new_weight = weight_dp[mask][pos] + weight
                        
                        if new_weight < weight_dp[new_mask][neighbor]:
                            dp[new_mask][neighbor] = True
                            weight_dp[new_mask][neighbor] = new_weight
        
        for mask in range(1 << n):
            if (bin(mask).count('1') == length and 
                dp[mask][end] and 
                weight_dp[mask][end] == target_weight):
                return True
        
        return False
    
    results = []
    for u, v, k, weight in queries:
        if has_weighted_hamiltonian_path(u, v, k, weight):
            results.append("YES")

            results.append("NO")
    
    return results
```

### Variation 2: Directed Hamiltonian Paths

def directed_hamiltonian_path_queries(n, edges, queries):
    # Build directed adjacency list
    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for a, b in edges:
        adj[a].append(b)  # Directed edge
    
    def has_directed_hamiltonian_path(start, end, length):
        dp = [[False] * (n + 1) for _ in range(1 << n)]
        dp[1 << (start - 1)][start] = True
        
        for mask in range(1 << n):
            for pos in range(1, n + 1):
                if not dp[mask][pos]:
                    continue
                
                for neighbor in adj[pos]:
                    if mask & (1 << (neighbor - 1)) == 0:
                        new_mask = mask | (1 << (neighbor - 1))
                        dp[new_mask][neighbor] = True
        
        for mask in range(1 << n):
            if bin(mask).count('1') == length and dp[mask][end]:
                return True
        
        return False
    
    results = []
    for u, v, k in queries:

            results.append("YES")
        else:
            results.append("NO")
    
    return results
```

### Variation 3: Hamiltonian Path Count

    # Build adjacency list
    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for a, b in edges:
        adj[a].append(b)
        adj[b].append(a)
    
    def count_hamiltonian_paths(start, end, length):
        dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(1 << n)]
        dp[1 << (start - 1)][start] = 1
        
        for mask in range(1 << n):
            for pos in range(1, n + 1):
                if dp[mask][pos] == 0:
                    continue
                
                for neighbor in adj[pos]:
                    if mask & (1 << (neighbor - 1)) == 0:
                        new_mask = mask | (1 << (neighbor - 1))
                        dp[new_mask][neighbor] += dp[mask][pos]
        
        total = 0
        for mask in range(1 << n):
            if bin(mask).count('1') == length:
                total += dp[mask][end]
        
        return total
    
    results = []
    for u, v, k in queries:
        count = count_hamiltonian_paths(u, v, k)
        results.append(count)
    
    return results
```

### Variation 4: Constrained Hamiltonian Paths
**Problem**: Find Hamiltonian paths that satisfy certain constraints.

```python
def constrained_hamiltonian_path_queries(n, edges, constraints, queries):
    # constraints: set of forbidden vertex pairs
    # Build adjacency list with constraints
    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for a, b in edges:
        if (a, b) not in constraints and (b, a) not in constraints:
            adj[a].append(b)
            adj[b].append(a)
    
    def has_constrained_hamiltonian_path(start, end, length):
        dp = [[False] * (n + 1) for _ in range(1 << n)]
        dp[1 << (start - 1)][start] = True
        
        for mask in range(1 << n):
            for pos in range(1, n + 1):
                if not dp[mask][pos]:
                    continue
                
                for neighbor in adj[pos]:
                    if mask & (1 << (neighbor - 1)) == 0:
                        new_mask = mask | (1 << (neighbor - 1))
                        dp[new_mask][neighbor] = True
        
        for mask in range(1 << n):
            if bin(mask).count('1') == length and dp[mask][end]:
                return True
        
        return False
    
    results = []
    for u, v, k in queries:
        if has_constrained_hamiltonian_path(u, v, k):
            results.append("YES")
        else:
            results.append("NO")
    
    return results
```
