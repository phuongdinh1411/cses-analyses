## 🔍 Solution Analysis: From Brute Force to Optimal

### Approach 1: Brute Force Solution

**Key Insights from Brute Force Solution**:
- **Exhaustive Search**: Try all possible combinations of office placements
- **Coverage Validation**: For each combination, verify all nodes are covered
- **Combinatorial Explosion**: 2^n possible subsets of nodes to place offices
- **Baseline Understanding**: Provides theoretical minimum but impractical

**Key Insight**: Generate all possible office placement combinations and find the minimum that covers all nodes.

**Algorithm**:
- Generate all possible subsets of nodes (2^n combinations)
- For each subset, check if it covers all nodes within distance k
- Return the smallest subset that provides full coverage

**Visual Example**:
```
Tree: 1-2-3, k=1

All possible office placements:
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ {}: No coverage                     │
│ {1}: Covers {1, 2}                 │
│ {2}: Covers {1, 2, 3} ✓            │
│ {3}: Covers {2, 3}                 │
│ {1,2}: Covers {1, 2, 3} ✓          │
│ {1,3}: Covers {1, 2, 3} ✓          │
│ {2,3}: Covers {1, 2, 3} ✓          │
│ {1,2,3}: Covers {1, 2, 3} ✓        │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

Minimum: {2} with 1 office
```

**Implementation**:

    """

    """
    from itertools import combinations
    
    # Build adjacency list

    def bfs_coverage(offices, k):
        """Find all nodes covered by given offices"""
        covered = set()
        
        for office in offices:
            queue = [(office, 0)]
            visited = {office}
            
            while queue:

            if len(covered) == n:
                return size

result = brute_force_solution(n, k, edges)
print(f"Brute force result: {result}")  # Output: 1
```

**Time Complexity**: O(2^n × n²)
**Space Complexity**: O(n)

**Why it's inefficient**: Exponential time complexity makes it impractical for large trees.

### Approach 2: Greedy Solution

**Key Insights from Greedy Solution**:
- **Greedy Strategy**: Place office at node that covers most uncovered nodes
- **BFS Coverage**: Use BFS to find all nodes within distance k
- **Iterative Placement**: Repeat until all nodes are covered
- **Local Optimization**: Each step makes locally optimal choice

**Key Insight**: Use greedy algorithm to place offices at nodes that cover the most uncovered nodes.

**Algorithm**:
- Build adjacency list from edges
- While there are uncovered nodes:
  - Find node that covers most uncovered nodes using BFS
  - Place office at that node
  - Mark covered nodes as covered
- Return number of offices placed

**Visual Example**:
```
Tree: 1-2-3-4-5, k=2

Step 1: Find coverage for each node
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Node 1: covers {1, 2, 3}           │
│ Node 2: covers {1, 2, 3, 4}        │
│ Node 3: covers {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}     │ ← Best
│ Node 4: covers {2, 3, 4, 5}        │
│ Node 5: covers {3, 4, 5}           │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

Step 2: Place office at node 3
Coverage: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
All nodes covered ✓
Result: 1 office
```

**Implementation**:
```python
def greedy_solution(n, k, edges):
    """
    Find minimum offices using greedy placement strategy
    
    Args:
        n: number of nodes
        k: maximum distance
        edges: list of (a, b) representing edges
    
    Returns:
        int: minimum number of offices needed
    """
    # Build adjacency list
    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for a, b in edges:

        adj[b].append(a)
    
    def bfs_coverage(start, k):
        """Find all nodes within distance k from start"""
        queue = [(start, 0)]
        visited = {start}
        covered = {start}
        
        while queue:
            node, dist = queue.pop(0)
            
            if dist >= k:
                continue
                
            for neighbor in adj[node]:
                if neighbor not in visited:
                    visited.add(neighbor)
                    covered.add(neighbor)
                    queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))
        
        return covered
    
    uncovered = set(range(1, n + 1))
    offices = 0
    
    while uncovered:
        # Find node that covers most uncovered nodes
        best_node = None
        best_coverage = 0
        
        for node in range(1, n + 1):
            coverage = bfs_coverage(node, k)
            uncovered_coverage = len(coverage & uncovered)
            if uncovered_coverage > best_coverage:
                best_coverage = uncovered_coverage
                best_node = node
        
        # Place office at best node
        if best_node:
            coverage = bfs_coverage(best_node, k)
            uncovered -= coverage
            offices += 1
    
    return offices

# Example usage
n, k = 5, 2
edges = [(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5)]
result = greedy_solution(n, k, edges)
print(f"Greedy result: {result}")  # Output: 1
```

**Time Complexity**: O(n²)
**Space Complexity**: O(n)

**Why it's better**: Much faster than brute force, but still not optimal for large trees.

**Implementation Considerations**:
- **BFS Efficiency**: Use BFS for coverage calculation
- **Greedy Choice**: Always choose node with maximum uncovered coverage
- **Termination**: Stop when all nodes are covered

### Approach 3: Tree Diameter Solution (Optimal)

**Key Insights from Tree Diameter Solution**:
- **Diameter Property**: Longest path in tree determines optimal placement
- **Center Placement**: Optimal offices are placed along the diameter
- **Mathematical Formula**: Offices needed = (diameter + 2*k - 1) // (2*k)
- **BFS Diameter**: Use BFS to find tree diameter efficiently

**Key Insight**: Use tree diameter to determine optimal office placement along the longest path.

**Algorithm**:
- Find tree diameter using BFS from arbitrary node
- Find diameter endpoints using BFS from first endpoint
- Calculate minimum offices needed using diameter formula
- Return the result

**Visual Example**:
```
Tree: 1-2-3-4-5, k=2

Step 1: Find diameter
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Start from node 1                  │
│ BFS finds farthest: node 5         │
│ Distance: 4 (path 1→2→3→4→5)       │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

Step 2: Calculate offices needed
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Diameter = 4                       │
│ k = 2                              │
│ Offices = (4 + 2*2 - 1) // (2*2)  │
│ Offices = (4 + 4 - 1) // 4        │
│ Offices = 7 // 4 = 1               │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

Result: 1 office at center (node 3)
```

        n: number of nodes

    Returns:
        int: minimum number of offices needed
    """
    # Build adjacency list
    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for a, b in edges:
        adj[a].append(b)
        adj[b].append(a)
    
    def bfs(start):
        """Find farthest node and distance from start"""
        queue = [(start, 0)]
        visited = {start}
        max_dist = 0
        farthest_node = start
        
        while queue:
            node, dist = queue.pop(0)
            
            if dist > max_dist:
                max_dist = dist
                farthest_node = node
            
            for neighbor in adj[node]:
                if neighbor not in visited:
                    visited.add(neighbor)
                    queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))
        
        return farthest_node, max_dist
    
    # Find diameter endpoints
    start = 1
    end1, _ = bfs(start)
    end2, diameter = bfs(end1)
    
    # Calculate minimum offices needed
    if k >= diameter:
        return 1
    else:
        offices = (diameter + 2*k - 1) // (2*k)
        return offices

# Example usage
n, k = 5, 2
edges = [(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5)]
result = tree_diameter_solution(n, k, edges)
print(f"Tree diameter result: {result}")  # Output: 1
```

**Time Complexity**: O(n)
**Space Complexity**: O(n)

**Why it's optimal**: O(n) complexity is optimal and uses mathematical properties of tree diameter for guaranteed optimal placement.

**Implementation Details**:
- **BFS Efficiency**: Use BFS instead of DFS for diameter finding
- **Diameter Formula**: (diameter + 2*k - 1) // (2*k) gives optimal result
- **Edge Cases**: Handle single node and small trees correctly
- **Mathematical Proof**: Tree diameter approach is provably optimal

## 🔧 Implementation Details

| Approach | Time Complexity | Space Complexity | Key Insight |
|----------|----------------|------------------|-------------|
| Brute Force | O(2^n × n²) | O(n) | Exhaustive search of all combinations |
| Greedy | O(n²) | O(n) | Place offices at nodes covering most uncovered nodes |
| Tree Diameter | O(n) | O(n) | Use tree diameter for optimal placement |

### Time Complexity
- **Time**: O(n) - Two BFS traversals to find tree diameter
- **Space**: O(n) - Adjacency list and BFS queue

### Why This Solution Works
- **Tree Diameter**: Longest path in tree determines optimal office placement
- **Mathematical Formula**: (diameter + 2*k - 1) // (2*k) gives minimum offices needed
- **BFS Efficiency**: Linear time complexity for diameter finding
- **Optimal Placement**: Tree diameter approach is provably optimal

## 🚀 Problem Variations

### Extended Problems with Detailed Code Examples

#### **1. Weighted Tree Offices**
**Problem**: Each edge has a weight, find minimum offices with weighted distances.

**Key Differences**: Edge weights affect coverage distances

**Solution Approach**: Use weighted BFS for coverage calculation

                best_node = node
        
        if best_node:
            coverage = weighted_bfs(best_node, k)
            uncovered -= coverage
            offices += 1
    
    return offices

# Example usage

weights = [2, 1, 2]
result = weighted_creating_offices(n, k, edges, weights)
print(f"Weighted offices result: {result}")
```

#### **2. Constrained Office Placement**
**Problem**: Some vertices cannot have offices placed on them.

print(f"Constrained offices result: {result}")
```

#### **3. Dynamic Office Placement**
**Problem**: Support adding/removing edges and answering office queries.

**Key Differences**: Tree structure can change dynamically
