- k: maximum distance from any node to nearest office
- n-1 lines: a b (edge between nodes a and b)

**Output**: 
- Minimum number of offices needed

**Constraints**:
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
- 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5
- 1 ≤ a,b ≤ n

**Example**:
```
Input:
5 2
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5

Output:
1

Explanation**: 
Place office at node 3. All nodes are within distance 2:
- Node 1: distance 2 from office at 3
- Node 2: distance 1 from office at 3
- Node 3: distance 0 from office at 3
- Node 4: distance 1 from office at 3
- Node 5: distance 2 from office at 3
```

### 📊 Visual Example

**Input Tree:**
```
    1 ──── 2 ──── 3 ──── 4 ──── 5
```

**Office Placement with k=2:**
```
Option 1: Place office at node 2
Coverage: 1, 2, 3 (distance ≤ 2)
Uncovered: 4, 5
Need another office at node 4
Total: 2 offices

Option 2: Place office at node 3
Coverage: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (all within distance 2)
Total: 1 office ✓ (optimal)
```

**Greedy Algorithm Visualization:**
```
Step 1: Find node with maximum coverage
Node 1: covers {1, 2, 3} (distance ≤ 2)
Node 2: covers {1, 2, 3, 4} (distance ≤ 2)
Node 3: covers {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} (distance ≤ 2) ← Best
Node 4: covers {2, 3, 4, 5} (distance ≤ 2)
Node 5: covers {3, 4, 5} (distance ≤ 2)

Step 2: Place office at node 3
All nodes covered: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
Result: 1 office needed
```

**Distance Coverage Visualization:**
```
k = 2 (maximum distance)

From node 3:
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Distance 0: {3}                     │
│ Distance 1: {2, 4}                  │
│ Distance 2: {1, 5}                  │
│ Total coverage: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}     │

│ Distance 2: {4}                     │
│ Total coverage: {1, 2, 3, 4}        │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Tree Structure Analysis:**
```
Tree diameter: 4 (path 1→2→3→4→5)
Optimal placement: At center (node 3)
Coverage radius: k = 2
All nodes within distance 2 of center
```

## 🔍 Solution Analysis: From Brute Force to Optimal

### Approach 1: Greedy Placement (Brute Force)

**Key Insights from Greedy Placement**:
- **Coverage Analysis**: Each office covers nodes within distance k
- **Greedy Strategy**: Place office at node that covers most uncovered nodes
- **BFS Coverage**: Use BFS to find all nodes within distance k
- **Iterative Placement**: Repeat until all nodes are covered

**Key Insight**: Use greedy algorithm to place offices at nodes that cover the most uncovered nodes.

**Algorithm**:
- Build adjacency list from edges
- While there are uncovered nodes:
  - Find node that covers most uncovered nodes using BFS
  - Place office at that node
  - Mark covered nodes as covered
- Return number of offices placed

**Visual Example**:
```
Tree: 1-2-3-4-5, k=2

Step 1: Find coverage for each node
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Node 1: covers {1, 2, 3}           │
│ Node 2: covers {1, 2, 3, 4}        │
│ Node 3: covers {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}     │ ← Best
│ Node 4: covers {2, 3, 4, 5}        │
│ Node 5: covers {3, 4, 5}           │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

Step 2: Place office at node 3
Coverage: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
All nodes covered ✓
Result: 1 office
```

**Implementation**:
```python
def greedy_placement_solution(n, k, edges):
    """
    Find minimum offices using greedy placement strategy
    
    Args:
        n: number of nodes
        k: maximum distance
        edges: list of (a, b) representing edges
    
    Returns:
        int: minimum number of offices needed
    """
    # Build adjacency list
    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for a, b in edges:
        adj[a].append(b)
        adj[b].append(a)
    
    def bfs_coverage(start, k):
        """Find all nodes within distance k from start"""
        queue = [(start, 0)]
        visited = {start}
        covered = {start}
        
        while queue:
            node, dist = queue.pop(0)
            
            if dist >= k:
                continue
                
            for neighbor in adj[node]:
                if neighbor not in visited:
                    visited.add(neighbor)
                    covered.add(neighbor)
                    queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))
        
        return covered
    
    uncovered = set(range(1, n + 1))
    offices = 0
    
    while uncovered:
        # Find node that covers most uncovered nodes
        best_node = None
        best_coverage = 0
        
        for node in range(1, n + 1):
            coverage = bfs_coverage(node, k)
            uncovered_coverage = len(coverage & uncovered)
            if uncovered_coverage > best_coverage:
                best_coverage = uncovered_coverage
                best_node = node
        
        # Place office at best node
        if best_node:
            coverage = bfs_coverage(best_node, k)
            uncovered -= coverage
            offices += 1
    
    return offices

# Example usage
n, k = 5, 2
edges = [(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5)]
result = greedy_placement_solution(n, k, edges)
print(f"Greedy placement result: {result}")  # Output: 1
```

**Time Complexity**: O(n²)
**Space Complexity**: O(n)

**Why it's inefficient**: O(n²) complexity is too slow for large trees with n up to 10^5.

### Approach 2: Tree Diameter Analysis (Optimized)

**Key Insights from Tree Diameter Analysis**:
- **Diameter Property**: Longest path in tree determines optimal placement
- **Center Placement**: Optimal offices are placed along the diameter
- **Distance Formula**: Offices needed = (diameter + 2*k - 1) // (2*k)
- **BFS Diameter**: Use BFS to find tree diameter efficiently

**Key Insight**: Use tree diameter to determine optimal office placement along the longest path.

**Algorithm**:
- Find tree diameter using BFS from arbitrary node
- Find diameter endpoints using BFS from first endpoint
- Calculate minimum offices needed using diameter formula
- Return the result

**Visual Example**:
```
Tree: 1-2-3-4-5, k=2

Step 1: Find diameter
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Start from node 1                  │
│ BFS finds farthest: node 5         │
│ Distance: 4 (path 1→2→3→4→5)       │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

Step 2: Calculate offices needed
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Diameter = 4                       │
│ k = 2                              │
│ Offices = (4 + 2*2 - 1) // (2*2)  │
│ Offices = (4 + 4 - 1) // 4        │
│ Offices = 7 // 4 = 1               │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

Result: 1 office at center (node 3)
```

**Implementation**:
```python
def tree_diameter_solution(n, k, edges):
    """
    Find minimum offices using tree diameter analysis
    
    Args:
        n: number of nodes
        k: maximum distance
        edges: list of (a, b) representing edges
    
    Returns:
        int: minimum number of offices needed
    """
    # Build adjacency list
    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for a, b in edges:
        adj[a].append(b)
        adj[b].append(a)
    
    def bfs(start):
        """Find farthest node and distance from start"""
        queue = [(start, 0)]
        visited = {start}
        max_dist = 0
        farthest_node = start
        
        while queue:
            node, dist = queue.pop(0)
            
            if dist > max_dist:
                max_dist = dist
                farthest_node = node
            
            for neighbor in adj[node]:
                if neighbor not in visited:
                    visited.add(neighbor)
                    queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))
        
        return farthest_node, max_dist
    
    # Find diameter endpoints
    start = 1
    end1, _ = bfs(start)
    end2, diameter = bfs(end1)
    
    # Calculate minimum offices needed
    offices = (diameter + 2*k - 1) // (2*k)
    return offices

# Example usage
n, k = 5, 2
edges = [(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5)]
result = tree_diameter_solution(n, k, edges)
print(f"Tree diameter result: {result}")  # Output: 1
```

**Time Complexity**: O(n)
**Space Complexity**: O(n)

**Why it's better**: O(n) complexity is much faster and uses the mathematical property of tree diameter for optimal placement.

**Implementation Considerations**:
- **BFS Efficiency**: Use BFS instead of DFS for diameter finding
- **Diameter Formula**: (diameter + 2*k - 1) // (2*k) gives optimal result
- **Edge Cases**: Handle single node and small trees correctly

### Step 3: Complete Solution
**Putting it all together:**

```python
def solve_creating_offices():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    edges = []
    
    for _ in range(n - 1):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        edges.append((a, b))
    
    # Build adjacency list
    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for a, b in edges:
        adj[a].append(b)
        adj[b].append(a)
    
    # Find tree diameter
    def bfs(start):
        queue = [(start, 0)]
        visited = {start}
        max_dist = 0
        farthest_node = start
        
        while queue:
            node, dist = queue.pop(0)
            
            if dist > max_dist:
                max_dist = dist
                farthest_node = node
            
            for neighbor in adj[node]:
                if neighbor not in visited:
                    visited.add(neighbor)
                    queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))
        
        return farthest_node, max_dist
    
    # Find diameter endpoints
    start = 1
    end1, _ = bfs(start)
    end2, diameter = bfs(end1)
    
    # Place offices along diameter
    offices = (diameter + 2*k - 1) // (2*k)
    print(offices)

# Main execution
if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve_creating_offices()
```

**Why this works:**
- Optimal tree diameter approach
- Handles all edge cases
- Efficient implementation
- Clear and readable code

### Step 4: Testing Our Solution

def test_solution():
    test_cases = [
        (5, 2, [(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5)]),
        (4, 1, [(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4)]),
        (6, 1, [(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 6)]),
    ]
    
    for n, k, edges in test_cases:
        result = solve_test(n, k, edges)
        print(f"n={n}, k={k}, edges={edges}")
        print(f"Result: {result}")
        print()

def solve_test(n, k, edges):
    # Build adjacency list
    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for a, b in edges:
        adj[a].append(b)
        adj[b].append(a)
    
    # Find tree diameter
    def bfs(start):
        queue = [(start, 0)]
        visited = {start}
        max_dist = 0
        farthest_node = start
        
        while queue:
            node, dist = queue.pop(0)
            
            if dist > max_dist:
                max_dist = dist
                farthest_node = node
            
            for neighbor in adj[node]:
                if neighbor not in visited:
                    visited.add(neighbor)
                    queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))
        
        return farthest_node, max_dist
    
    # Find diameter endpoints
    start = 1
    end1, _ = bfs(start)
    end2, diameter = bfs(end1)
    
    # Place offices along diameter
    offices = (diameter + 2*k - 1) // (2*k)
    return offices

## 🎯 Problem Variations

### Variation 1: Creating Offices with Weights
**Problem**: Each node has a weight, find minimum weight offices.

```python
def weighted_creating_offices(n, k, edges, weights):
    # Build adjacency list
    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for a, b in edges:
        adj[a].append(b)
        adj[b].append(a)
    
    # Find tree diameter
    def bfs(start):
        queue = [(start, 0)]
        visited = {start}
        max_dist = 0
        farthest_node = start
        
        while queue:
            node, dist = queue.pop(0)
            
            if dist > max_dist:
                max_dist = dist
                farthest_node = node
            
            for neighbor in adj[node]:
                if neighbor not in visited:
                    visited.add(neighbor)
                    queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))
        
        return farthest_node, max_dist
    
    # Find diameter endpoints
    start = 1
    end1, _ = bfs(start)
    end2, diameter = bfs(end1)
    
    # Find minimum weight nodes along diameter
    # This is a more complex problem requiring dynamic programming
    # For now, return the basic solution
    offices = (diameter + 2*k - 1) // (2*k)
    return offices
```

### Variation 2: Creating Offices with Constraints
**Problem**: Can only place offices at certain nodes.

```python
def constrained_creating_offices(n, k, edges, allowed_nodes):
    # Build adjacency list
    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for a, b in edges:
        adj[a].append(b)
        adj[b].append(a)
    
    # Greedy placement with constraints
    def bfs_coverage(start, k):
        queue = [(start, 0)]
        visited = {start}
        covered = {start}
        
        while queue:
            node, dist = queue.pop(0)
            
            if dist >= k:
                continue
                
            for neighbor in adj[node]:
                if neighbor not in visited:
                    visited.add(neighbor)
                    covered.add(neighbor)
                    queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))
        
        return covered
    
    uncovered = set(range(1, n + 1))
    offices = 0
    
    while uncovered:
        # Find allowed node that covers most uncovered nodes
        best_node = None
        best_coverage = 0
        
        for node in allowed_nodes:
            if node in uncovered:
                coverage = bfs_coverage(node, k)
                uncovered_coverage = len(coverage & uncovered)
                if uncovered_coverage > best_coverage:
                    best_coverage = uncovered_coverage
                    best_node = node
        
        # Place office at best node
        if best_node:
            coverage = bfs_coverage(best_node, k)
            uncovered -= coverage
            offices += 1
        else:
            return -1  # Impossible
    
    return offices
```

### Variation 3: Creating Offices with Multiple Types
**Problem**: Different types of offices with different coverage ranges.

```python
def multi_type_creating_offices(n, edges, office_types):
    # Build adjacency list
    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for a, b in edges:
        adj[a].append(b)
        adj[b].append(a)
    
    # office_types: [(type, coverage, cost), ...]
    
    def bfs_coverage(start, coverage):
        queue = [(start, 0)]
        visited = {start}
        covered = {start}
        
        while queue:
            node, dist = queue.pop(0)
            
            if dist >= coverage:
                continue
                
            for neighbor in adj[node]:
                if neighbor not in visited:
                    visited.add(neighbor)
                    covered.add(neighbor)
                    queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))
        
        return covered
    
    uncovered = set(range(1, n + 1))
    total_cost = 0
    
    while uncovered:
        # Find best office type and location
        best_cost = float('inf')
        best_node = None
        best_type = None
        
        for node in range(1, n + 1):
            for office_type, coverage, cost in office_types:
                if node in uncovered:
                    coverage_set = bfs_coverage(node, coverage)
                    uncovered_coverage = len(coverage_set & uncovered)
                    if uncovered_coverage > 0:
                        cost_per_node = cost / uncovered_coverage
                        if cost_per_node < best_cost:
                            best_cost = cost_per_node
                            best_node = node

### Variation 4: Dynamic Creating Offices
**Problem**: Support adding/removing edges and maintaining office coverage.

```python

### Variation 5: Creating Offices with Multiple Constraints
**Problem**: Find minimum offices satisfying multiple constraints.

```python

            for neighbor in adj[node]:
                if neighbor not in visited:
                    visited.add(neighbor)
                    covered.add(neighbor)
                    queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))
        
        return covered
    
    uncovered = set(range(1, n + 1))
    offices = 0
    
    while uncovered and offices < max_offices:
        # Find allowed node that covers most uncovered nodes
        best_node = None
        best_coverage = 0
        
        for node in allowed_nodes:
            if node in uncovered:
                coverage = bfs_coverage(node, k)
                uncovered_coverage = len(coverage & uncovered)

                    best_node = node
        
        # Place office at best node
        if best_node:
            coverage = bfs_coverage(best_node, k)
            uncovered -= coverage
            offices += 1
        else:
            return -1  # Impossible
    
    return offices if not uncovered else -1
```

            for neighbor in adj[node]:
                if neighbor not in visited:
                    visited.add(neighbor)
                    queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))
        
        # Second BFS from farthest node
        queue = deque([(farthest_node, 0)])
        visited = {farthest_node}
        diameter = 0

## 🎯 Problem Variations

### Variation 1: Weighted Tree Offices
**Problem**: Each edge has a weight, find minimum offices with weighted distances.

```python
def weighted_creating_offices(n, k, edges, weights):
    # Build weighted adjacency list
    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for i, (a, b) in enumerate(edges):
        adj[a].append((b, weights[i]))
        adj[b].append((a, weights[i]))
    
    # Find weighted tree diameter
    def find_weighted_diameter():
        from collections import deque
        
        # First BFS to find farthest node
        queue = deque([(1, 0)])
        visited = {1}
        farthest_node = 1
        max_dist = 0
        
        while queue:
            node, dist = queue.popleft()
            if dist > max_dist:
                max_dist = dist
                farthest_node = node
            
            for neighbor, weight in adj[node]:
                if neighbor not in visited:
                    visited.add(neighbor)
                    queue.append((neighbor, dist + weight))
        
        # Second BFS from farthest node
        queue = deque([(farthest_node, 0)])
        visited = {farthest_node}
        diameter = 0
        
        while queue:
            node, dist = queue.popleft()
            diameter = max(diameter, dist)
            
            for neighbor, weight in adj[node]:
                if neighbor not in visited:
                    visited.add(neighbor)
                    queue.append((neighbor, dist + weight))
        
        return diameter
    
    diameter = find_weighted_diameter()
    return (diameter + 2*k) // (2*k + 1)
```

### Variation 2: Office Placement with Constraints
**Problem**: Some vertices cannot have offices placed on them.

def constrained_creating_offices(n, k, edges, forbidden_vertices):
    # Build adjacency list
    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for a, b in edges:
        adj[a].append(b)
        adj[b].append(a)
    
    # Greedy placement avoiding forbidden vertices
    def bfs_coverage(start, k):
        from collections import deque
        queue = deque([(start, 0)])
        visited = {start}
        covered = {start}
        
        while queue:
            node, dist = queue.popleft()
            
            if dist >= k:
                continue
                
            for neighbor in adj[node]:
                if neighbor not in visited:
                    visited.add(neighbor)
                    covered.add(neighbor)
                    queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))
        
        return covered
    
    uncovered = set(range(1, n + 1))
    offices = 0
    
    while uncovered:
        # Find best allowed vertex
        best_node = None
        best_coverage = 0
        
        for node in range(1, n + 1):
            if node not in forbidden_vertices:
                coverage = bfs_coverage(node, k)
                uncovered_coverage = len(coverage & uncovered)
                if uncovered_coverage > best_coverage:
                    best_coverage = uncovered_coverage
                    best_node = node
        
        if best_node:
            coverage = bfs_coverage(best_node, k)
            uncovered -= coverage
            offices += 1
        else:
            return -1  # Impossible
    
    return offices
```

```python
class DynamicCreatingOffices:
    def __init__(self, n):
        self.n = n
        self.adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]

                        visited.add(neighbor)
                        queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))
            
            return diameter
        
        diameter = find_diameter()
        return (diameter + 2*k) // (2*k + 1)
```

### Variation 4: Office Placement with Costs
**Problem**: Each vertex has a cost for placing an office, minimize total cost.

```python
def cost_creating_offices(n, k, edges, costs):
    # Build adjacency list
    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for a, b in edges:
        adj[a].append(b)
        adj[b].append(a)
    
    # Greedy placement with cost consideration
    def bfs_coverage(start, k):
        from collections import deque
        queue = deque([(start, 0)])
        visited = {start}
        covered = {start}
        
        while queue:
            node, dist = queue.popleft()
            
            if dist >= k:
                continue
                
            for neighbor in adj[node]:
                if neighbor not in visited:
                    visited.add(neighbor)
                    covered.add(neighbor)
                    queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))
        
        return covered
    
    uncovered = set(range(1, n + 1))
    total_cost = 0
    
    while uncovered:
        # Find best cost-effective vertex
        best_node = None
        best_ratio = 0
        
        for node in range(1, n + 1):
            coverage = bfs_coverage(node, k)
            uncovered_coverage = len(coverage & uncovered)
            if uncovered_coverage > 0:
                ratio = uncovered_coverage / costs[node]
                if ratio > best_ratio:
                    best_ratio = ratio
                    best_node = node
        
        if best_node:
            coverage = bfs_coverage(best_node, k)
            uncovered -= coverage
            total_cost += costs[best_node]
        else:
            return -1  # Impossible
    
    return total_cost
```

### Variation 5: Office Placement with Multiple Coverage
**Problem**: Each vertex must be covered by at least m offices.

```python
def multiple_coverage_offices(n, k, edges, m):
    # Build adjacency list
    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for a, b in edges:
        adj[a].append(b)
        adj[b].append(a)
    
    # Track coverage count for each vertex
    coverage_count = [0] * (n + 1)
    
    def bfs_coverage(start, k):
        from collections import deque
        queue = deque([(start, 0)])
        visited = {start}
        covered = {start}
        
        while queue:
            node, dist = queue.popleft()
            
            if dist >= k:
                continue
                
            for neighbor in adj[node]:
                if neighbor not in visited:
                    visited.add(neighbor)
                    covered.add(neighbor)
                    queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))
        
        return covered
    
    offices = 0
    
    while True:
        # Find vertex that needs most coverage
        max_deficit = 0
        best_node = None
        
        for node in range(1, n + 1):
            deficit = max(0, m - coverage_count[node])
            if deficit > max_deficit:
                max_deficit = deficit
                best_node = node
        
        if max_deficit == 0:
            break  # All vertices are sufficiently covered
        
        # Place office at best node
        coverage = bfs_coverage(best_node, k)
        for node in coverage:
            coverage_count[node] += 1
        offices += 1
    
    return offices
```

    else:
        # Offices needed = ceil(diameter / (2*k + 1))
        return (diameter + 2*k) // (2*k + 1)
```

**Why this improvement works**: Uses tree diameter properties to determine optimal office placement.

### Approach 2: Optimal Tree Coverage - O(n)
**Description**: Use a more sophisticated approach based on tree properties.

```python
def creating_offices_optimal(n, k, edges):
    # Build adjacency list
    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for a, b in edges:
        adj[a].append(b)
        adj[b].append(a)
    
    def find_farthest(start):
        queue = [(start, 0)]
        visited = {start}
        farthest_node = start
        max_dist = 0
        
        while queue:
            node, dist = queue.pop(0)
            
            if dist > max_dist:
                max_dist = dist
                farthest_node = node
            
            for neighbor in adj[node]:
                if neighbor not in visited:
                    visited.add(neighbor)
                    queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))
        
        return farthest_node, max_dist
    
    def find_diameter():
        # Find one end of diameter
        end1, _ = find_farthest(1)
        # Find other end
        end2, diameter = find_farthest(end1)
        return diameter
    
    # Find tree diameter
    diameter = find_diameter()
    
    # Calculate minimum offices needed
    if k >= diameter:
        return 1
    else:
        # Minimum offices = ceil(diameter / (2*k + 1))
        return (diameter + 2*k) // (2*k + 1)
```

#### 3. **Creating Offices with Probabilities**
**Variation**: Each potential office location has a probability of being successful.
**Approach**: Use Monte Carlo simulation or expected value calculation.
```python
def probabilistic_creating_offices(n, k, edges, office_probabilities):
    # office_probabilities[i] = probability office at node i will be successful
    
    def monte_carlo_simulation(trials=1000):
        successful_coverages = 0
        
        for _ in range(trials):
            if can_cover_tree_with_probabilities(n, k, edges, office_probabilities):
                successful_coverages += 1
        
        return successful_coverages / trials

        # Simulate office creation with probabilities
        available_offices = []
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if random.random() < probs.get(i, 0.5):
                available_offices.append(i)
        
        # Check if available offices can cover the tree
        return can_cover_tree(n, k, edges, available_offices)
    
    def can_cover_tree(n, k, edges, offices):
        if not offices:
            return False
        
        # Build adjacency list
        adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
        for a, b in edges:

            adj[b].append(a)
        
        # Check coverage from all offices
        covered = set()
        
        for office in offices:
            queue = [(office, 0)]
            visited = {office}
            
            while queue:
                node, dist = queue.pop(0)

        return len(covered) == n
    
    return monte_carlo_simulation()
```

#### 4. **Creating Offices with Multiple Criteria**
**Variation**: Optimize for multiple objectives (cost, coverage quality, accessibility).
**Approach**: Use multi-objective optimization or weighted sum approach.
```python
def multi_criteria_creating_offices(n, k, edges, criteria_weights):
    # criteria_weights = {'cost': 0.4, 'coverage_quality': 0.3, 'accessibility': 0.3}
    # Each potential office has multiple attributes

        return (criteria_weights['cost'] * office_attributes['cost'] + 
                criteria_weights['coverage_quality'] * office_attributes['coverage_quality'] + 
                criteria_weights['accessibility'] * office_attributes['accessibility'])

            adj[a].append(b)
            adj[b].append(a)
        
        # Find tree diameter

            end1, _ = find_farthest(1)
            end2, diameter = find_farthest(end1)
            return diameter
        
        diameter = find_diameter()
        min_offices = (diameter + 2*k) // (2*k + 1) if k < diameter else 1
        
        # Evaluate each potential office location
        office_scores = []
        for i in range(1, n + 1):

                    for neighbor in adj[node]:
                        if neighbor not in visited:

                            queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))
            
            office_attrs = {
                'cost': 1,  # Assuming unit cost
                'coverage_quality': coverage_quality,
