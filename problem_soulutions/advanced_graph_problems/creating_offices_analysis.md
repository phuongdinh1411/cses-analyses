# Creating Offices

## Problem Statement
Given a tree with n nodes, you need to place offices at some nodes so that every node is within distance k of at least one office. Find the minimum number of offices needed.

### Input
The first input line has two integers n and k: the number of nodes and the maximum distance.
Then there are n-1 lines describing the tree edges. Each line has two integers a and b: there is an edge between nodes a and b.

### Output
Print the minimum number of offices needed.

### Constraints
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
- 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5
- 1 ≤ a,b ≤ n

### Example
```
Input:
5 2
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5

Output:
2
```

## Solution Progression

### Approach 1: Greedy Placement - O(n²)
**Description**: Place offices greedily by finding the node that covers the most uncovered nodes.

```python
def creating_offices_naive(n, k, edges):
    # Build adjacency list
    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for a, b in edges:
        adj[a].append(b)
        adj[b].append(a)
    
    def bfs_coverage(start, k):
        queue = [(start, 0)]
        visited = {start}
        covered = {start}
        
        while queue:
            node, dist = queue.pop(0)
            
            if dist >= k:
                continue
                
            for neighbor in adj[node]:
                if neighbor not in visited:
                    visited.add(neighbor)
                    covered.add(neighbor)
                    queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))
        
        return covered
    
    uncovered = set(range(1, n + 1))
    offices = 0
    
    while uncovered:
        # Find node that covers most uncovered nodes
        best_node = None
        best_coverage = 0
        
        for node in range(1, n + 1):
            coverage = bfs_coverage(node, k)
            uncovered_coverage = len(coverage & uncovered)
            if uncovered_coverage > best_coverage:
                best_coverage = uncovered_coverage
                best_node = node
        
        # Place office at best node
        if best_node:
            coverage = bfs_coverage(best_node, k)
            uncovered -= coverage
            offices += 1
    
    return offices
```

**Why this is inefficient**: O(n²) complexity is too slow for large trees.

### Improvement 1: Tree Diameter Approach - O(n)
**Description**: Use the tree diameter to find optimal office placement.

```python
def creating_offices_improved(n, k, edges):
    # Build adjacency list
    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for a, b in edges:
        adj[a].append(b)
        adj[b].append(a)
    
    def find_farthest(start):
        queue = [(start, 0)]
        visited = {start}
        farthest_node = start
        max_dist = 0
        
        while queue:
            node, dist = queue.pop(0)
            
            if dist > max_dist:
                max_dist = dist
                farthest_node = node
            
            for neighbor in adj[node]:
                if neighbor not in visited:
                    visited.add(neighbor)
                    queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))
        
        return farthest_node, max_dist
    
    def find_diameter():
        # Find one end of diameter
        end1, _ = find_farthest(1)
        # Find other end
        end2, diameter = find_farthest(end1)
        return end1, end2, diameter
    
    # Find tree diameter
    end1, end2, diameter = find_diameter()
    
    # Calculate minimum offices needed
    if k >= diameter:
        return 1
    else:
        # Offices needed = ceil(diameter / (2*k + 1))
        return (diameter + 2*k) // (2*k + 1)
```

**Why this improvement works**: Uses tree diameter properties to determine optimal office placement.

### Approach 2: Optimal Tree Coverage - O(n)
**Description**: Use a more sophisticated approach based on tree properties.

```python
def creating_offices_optimal(n, k, edges):
    # Build adjacency list
    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for a, b in edges:
        adj[a].append(b)
        adj[b].append(a)
    
    def find_farthest(start):
        queue = [(start, 0)]
        visited = {start}
        farthest_node = start
        max_dist = 0
        
        while queue:
            node, dist = queue.pop(0)
            
            if dist > max_dist:
                max_dist = dist
                farthest_node = node
            
            for neighbor in adj[node]:
                if neighbor not in visited:
                    visited.add(neighbor)
                    queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))
        
        return farthest_node, max_dist
    
    def find_diameter():
        # Find one end of diameter
        end1, _ = find_farthest(1)
        # Find other end
        end2, diameter = find_farthest(end1)
        return diameter
    
    # Find tree diameter
    diameter = find_diameter()
    
    # Calculate minimum offices needed
    if k >= diameter:
        return 1
    else:
        # Minimum offices = ceil(diameter / (2*k + 1))
        return (diameter + 2*k) // (2*k + 1)
```

**Why this improvement works**: Optimal solution using tree diameter and coverage properties.

## Final Optimal Solution

```python
n, k = map(int, input().split())
edges = []
for _ in range(n - 1):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    edges.append((a, b))

        adj[b].append(a)
    
    def find_farthest(start):
        queue = [(start, 0)]
        visited = {start}
        farthest_node = start
        max_dist = 0
        
        while queue:
            node, dist = queue.pop(0)
            
            if dist > max_dist:
                max_dist = dist
                farthest_node = node
            
            for neighbor in adj[node]:
                if neighbor not in visited:
                    visited.add(neighbor)
                    queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))
        
        return farthest_node, max_dist
    
    def find_diameter():
        # Find one end of diameter
        end1, _ = find_farthest(1)
        # Find other end
        end2, diameter = find_farthest(end1)
        return diameter
    
    # Find tree diameter
    diameter = find_diameter()
    
    # Calculate minimum offices needed
    if k >= diameter:
        return 1
    else:
        # Minimum offices = ceil(diameter / (2*k + 1))
        return (diameter + 2*k) // (2*k + 1)

result = find_minimum_offices(n, k, edges)
print(result)
```

**Variation**: Each office has a different cost, find minimum cost to cover the tree.
**Approach**: Use weighted tree coverage with cost optimization.

```

#### 2. **Creating Offices with Constraints**
**Variation**: Limited budget, restricted locations, or specific coverage requirements.
**Approach**: Use constraint satisfaction with tree coverage.
```python

#### 3. **Creating Offices with Probabilities**
**Variation**: Each potential office location has a probability of being successful.
**Approach**: Use Monte Carlo simulation or expected value calculation.
```python
def probabilistic_creating_offices(n, k, edges, office_probabilities):
    # office_probabilities[i] = probability office at node i will be successful
    
    def monte_carlo_simulation(trials=1000):
        successful_coverages = 0
        
        for _ in range(trials):
            if can_cover_tree_with_probabilities(n, k, edges, office_probabilities):
                successful_coverages += 1
        
        return successful_coverages / trials
    
    def can_cover_tree_with_probabilities(n, k, edges, probs):
        # Simulate office creation with probabilities
        available_offices = []
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if random.random() < probs.get(i, 0.5):
                available_offices.append(i)
        
        # Check if available offices can cover the tree
        return can_cover_tree(n, k, edges, available_offices)
    
    def can_cover_tree(n, k, edges, offices):
        if not offices:
            return False
        
        # Build adjacency list
        adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
        for a, b in edges:
            adj[a].append(b)
            adj[b].append(a)
        
        # Check coverage from all offices
        covered = set()
        
        for office in offices:
            queue = [(office, 0)]
            visited = {office}
            
            while queue:
                node, dist = queue.pop(0)
                if dist <= k:

        return len(covered) == n
    
    return monte_carlo_simulation()
```

#### 4. **Creating Offices with Multiple Criteria**
**Variation**: Optimize for multiple objectives (cost, coverage quality, accessibility).
**Approach**: Use multi-objective optimization or weighted sum approach.
```python
def multi_criteria_creating_offices(n, k, edges, criteria_weights):
    # criteria_weights = {'cost': 0.4, 'coverage_quality': 0.3, 'accessibility': 0.3}
    # Each potential office has multiple attributes
    
    def calculate_office_score(office_attributes):
        return (criteria_weights['cost'] * office_attributes['cost'] + 
                criteria_weights['coverage_quality'] * office_attributes['coverage_quality'] + 
                criteria_weights['accessibility'] * office_attributes['accessibility'])

        adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
        for a, b in edges:
            adj[a].append(b)
            adj[b].append(a)
        
        # Find tree diameter
        def find_diameter():
            def find_farthest(start):
                queue = [(start, 0)]

                            queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))
                
                return farthest_node, max_dist
            
            end1, _ = find_farthest(1)
            end2, diameter = find_farthest(end1)
            return diameter
        
        diameter = find_diameter()
        min_offices = (diameter + 2*k) // (2*k + 1) if k < diameter else 1
        
        # Evaluate each potential office location
        office_scores = []
        for i in range(1, n + 1):

            coverage_quality = 0
            queue = [(i, 0)]
            visited = {i}
            
            while queue:

                if dist <= k:
                    coverage_quality += 1 / (dist + 1)  # Closer nodes get higher quality
            
                if dist < k:
                    for neighbor in adj[node]:
                        if neighbor not in visited:

                            queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))
            
            office_attrs = {
                'cost': 1,  # Assuming unit cost
                'coverage_quality': coverage_quality,
                'accessibility': 1  # Assuming unit accessibility
            }

    return offices, total_score
```
