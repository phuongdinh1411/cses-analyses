# CSES Filled Subgrid Count I - Problem Analysis

## Problem Statement
Given a 2D grid of size n×m, count the number of filled subgrids of size k×k. A subgrid is filled if all cells in it contain the same value.

### Input
The first input line has three integers n, m, and k: the dimensions of the grid and the size of subgrids to count.
Then there are n lines describing the grid. Each line has m integers: the values in the grid.

### Output
Print one integer: the number of filled k×k subgrids.

### Constraints
- 1 ≤ n,m ≤ 100
- 1 ≤ k ≤ min(n,m)
- 1 ≤ grid[i][j] ≤ 10^9

### Example
```
Input:
3 3 2
1 1 2
1 1 2
3 3 3

Output:
2
```

## Solution Progression

### Approach 1: Check All Subgrids - O(n × m × k²)
**Description**: Check all possible k×k subgrids to count those that are filled.

```python
def filled_subgrid_count_naive(n, m, k, grid):
    count = 0
    
    for i in range(n - k + 1):
        for j in range(m - k + 1):
            # Check if this k×k subgrid is filled
            first_value = grid[i][j]
            is_filled = True
            
            for di in range(k):
                for dj in range(k):
                    if grid[i + di][j + dj] != first_value:
                        is_filled = False
                        break
                if not is_filled:
                    break
            
            if is_filled:
                count += 1
    
    return count
```

**Why this is inefficient**: For each subgrid, we need to check all k² cells, leading to O(n × m × k²) time complexity.

### Improvement 1: Optimized Checking with Early Termination - O(n × m × k²)
**Description**: Optimize the checking process with early termination when a mismatch is found.

```python
def filled_subgrid_count_optimized(n, m, k, grid):
    count = 0
    
    for i in range(n - k + 1):
        for j in range(m - k + 1):
            # Check if this k×k subgrid is filled
            first_value = grid[i][j]
            is_filled = True
            
            # Check each cell in the subgrid
            for di in range(k):
                for dj in range(k):
                    if grid[i + di][j + dj] != first_value:
                        is_filled = False
                        break
                if not is_filled:
                    break
            
            if is_filled:
                count += 1
    
    return count
```

**Why this improvement works**: Early termination reduces the number of cells checked when a mismatch is found early.

## Final Optimal Solution

```python
n, m, k = map(int, input().split())

# Read the grid
grid = []
for _ in range(n):
    row = list(map(int, input().split()))
    grid.append(row)

def count_filled_subgrids(n, m, k, grid):
    count = 0
    
    for i in range(n - k + 1):
        for j in range(m - k + 1):
            # Check if this k×k subgrid is filled
            first_value = grid[i][j]
            is_filled = True
            
            # Check each cell in the subgrid
            for di in range(k):
                for dj in range(k):
                    if grid[i + di][j + dj] != first_value:
                        is_filled = False
                        break
                if not is_filled:
                    break
            
            if is_filled:
                count += 1
    
    return count

result = count_filled_subgrids(n, m, k, grid)
print(result)
```

            pass
```

        # Note: No break here as we want to check all rows
    
    return True
```

## Problem-Solving Framework
