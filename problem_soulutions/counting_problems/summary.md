## Key Concepts & Techniques

### Combinatorial Principles

#### Addition Principle
- **When to use**: Counting disjoint cases that don't overlap
- **Formula**: If A and B are disjoint, |A ∪ B| = |A| + |B|
- **Example**: Count ways to choose red OR blue balls
- **Implementation**: Sum the counts of each case

#### Multiplication Principle
- **When to use**: Counting independent choices made sequentially
- **Formula**: If choices are independent, total = choice1 × choice2 × ...
- **Example**: Count ways to choose shirt AND pants AND shoes
- **Implementation**: Multiply the counts of each choice

#### Inclusion-Exclusion Principle
- **When to use**: Counting elements in union of overlapping sets
- **Formula**: |A ∪ B| = |A| + |B| - |A ∩ B|
- **Example**: Count numbers divisible by 2 OR 3
- **Implementation**: Add individual counts, subtract intersections

#### Binomial Coefficients
- **When to use**: Counting combinations (unordered selections)
- **Formula**: C(n,k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)
- **Example**: Count ways to choose k items from n items
- **Implementation**: Use factorial precomputation or Pascal's triangle

### Advanced Counting Techniques

#### Generating Functions
- **When to use**: Counting sequences with specific properties
- **Formula**: G(x) = Σ aₙxⁿ where aₙ is the count
- **Example**: Count ways to make change with coins
- **Implementation**: Use polynomial multiplication

#### Recurrence Relations
- **When to use**: When counting follows a pattern
- **Formula**: aₙ = f(aₙ₋₁, aₙ₋₂, ..., a₀)
- **Example**: Fibonacci sequence, Catalan numbers
- **Implementation**: Use dynamic programming or matrix exponentiation

#### Burnside's Lemma
- **When to use**: Counting objects under group actions (symmetry)
- **Formula**: |X/G| = (1/|G|) Σ |X^g| where X^g are fixed points
- **Example**: Count distinct colorings of a necklace
- **Implementation**: Count fixed points under each group action

#### Catalan Numbers
- **When to use**: Counting valid parentheses, binary trees, paths
- **Formula**: Cₙ = (1/(n+1)) × C(2n,n)
- **Example**: Count valid parentheses expressions
- **Implementation**: Use recurrence Cₙ = Σ Cᵢ × Cₙ₋₁₋ᵢ

### Mathematical Tools

#### Modular Arithmetic
- **When to use**: Handling large numbers that don't fit in standard types
- **Properties**: (a + b) mod m = ((a mod m) + (b mod m)) mod m
- **Example**: Count combinations modulo 10⁹ + 7
- **Implementation**: Apply modulo at each step to prevent overflow

#### Combinatorial Identities
- **When to use**: Simplifying complex counting expressions
- **Examples**: 
  - C(n,k) = C(n,n-k) (symmetry)
  - C(n,k) = C(n-1,k-1) + C(n-1,k) (Pascal's identity)
- **Implementation**: Use identities to reduce computation

#### Probability Theory
- **When to use**: Counting with probability or expected values
- **Formula**: P(A) = |A| / |S| where S is sample space
- **Example**: Expected number of inversions in random permutation
- **Implementation**: Count favorable outcomes / total outcomes

#### Number Theory
- **When to use**: Problems involving prime factorization or divisibility
- **Examples**: Count numbers with specific prime factors
- **Implementation**: Use sieve algorithms or factorization

### Specialized Counting Techniques

#### Stars and Bars
- **When to use**: Counting ways to distribute identical objects
- **Formula**: C(n+k-1, k-1) ways to distribute n objects into k bins
- **Example**: Count ways to distribute 10 identical balls into 3 boxes
- **Implementation**: Use binomial coefficient formula

#### Principle of Reflection
- **When to use**: Counting paths that avoid certain boundaries
- **Formula**: Total paths - reflected paths
- **Example**: Count paths from (0,0) to (n,m) staying above y=x
- **Implementation**: Use reflection to count invalid paths

#### Bijective Proofs
- **When to use**: Proving two sets have same size by finding bijection
- **Method**: Show one-to-one correspondence between sets
- **Example**: Prove C(n,k) = C(n,n-k) by showing bijection
- **Implementation**: Construct explicit mapping between sets

#### Pigeonhole Principle
- **When to use**: Proving existence of certain configurations
- **Statement**: If n+1 objects are placed in n boxes, some box has ≥2 objects
- **Example**: Prove that in any group of 13 people, two have same birthday month
- **Implementation**: Use contradiction or direct counting
