# Counting Bishops

## Problem Statement
Given a chessboard of size nÃ—n, count the number of ways to place k bishops such that no bishop attacks another bishop.

### Input
The first input line has two integers n and k: the size of the chessboard and the number of bishops to place.

### Output
Print one integer: the number of ways to place k bishops.

### Constraints
- 1 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 8
- 0 â‰¤ k â‰¤ nÂ²

### Example
```
Input:
3 2

Output:
26
```

## Solution Progression

### Approach 1: Generate All Placements - O(n^(nÂ²))
**Description**: Generate all possible placements of k bishops and check if they are valid.

```python
def counting_bishops_naive(n, k):
    from itertools import combinations
    
    # Generate all positions on the board
    positions = [(i, j) for i in range(n) for j in range(n)]
    
    count = 0
    
    # Try all combinations of k positions
    for bishop_positions in combinations(positions, k):
        # Check if bishops can attack each other
        valid = True
        for i in range(k):
            for j in range(i + 1, k):
                r1, c1 = bishop_positions[i]
                r2, c2 = bishop_positions[j]
                
                # Check if bishops attack each other (same diagonal)
                if abs(r1 - r2) == abs(c1 - c2):
                    valid = False
                    break
            if not valid:
                break
        
        if valid:
            count += 1
    
    return count
```

**Why this is inefficient**: We need to check all possible combinations of positions, leading to exponential time complexity.

### Improvement 1: Backtracking with Diagonal Tracking - O(n!)
**Description**: Use backtracking to place bishops one by one with diagonal tracking.

```python
def counting_bishops_backtracking(n, k):
    def can_place_bishop(row, col, diagonals):
        # Check if position is on any occupied diagonal
        for d in diagonals:
            if abs(row - d[0]) == abs(col - d[1]):
                return False
        return True
    
    def backtrack(bishops, remaining, diagonals):
        if remaining == 0:
            return 1
        
        count = 0
        start_pos = 0 if not bishops else bishops[-1][0] * n + bishops[-1][1] + 1
        
        for pos in range(start_pos, n * n):
            row, col = pos // n, pos % n
            
            if can_place_bishop(row, col, diagonals):
                bishops.append((row, col))
                diagonals.append((row, col))
                count += backtrack(bishops, remaining - 1, diagonals)
                diagonals.pop()
                bishops.pop()
        
        return count
    
    return backtrack([], k, [])
```

**Why this improvement works**: Backtracking with diagonal tracking avoids checking invalid combinations early.

## Final Optimal Solution

```python
n, k = map(int, input().split())

def count_bishop_placements(n, k):
    def can_place_bishop(row, col, diagonals):
        # Check if position is on any occupied diagonal
        for d in diagonals:
            if abs(row - d[0]) == abs(col - d[1]):
                return False
        return True
    
    def backtrack(bishops, remaining, diagonals):
        if remaining == 0:
            return 1
        
        count = 0
        start_pos = 0 if not bishops else bishops[-1][0] * n + bishops[-1][1] + 1
        
        for pos in range(start_pos, n * n):
            row, col = pos // n, pos % n
            
            if can_place_bishop(row, col, diagonals):
                bishops.append((row, col))
                diagonals.append((row, col))
                count += backtrack(bishops, remaining - 1, diagonals)
                diagonals.pop()
                bishops.pop()
        
        return count
    
    return backtrack([], k, [])

result = count_bishop_placements(n, k)
print(result)
```

## Notable Techniques

### 1. **Bishop Attack Check**
```python
def can_place_bishop(row, col, bishops):
    for br, bc in bishops:
        if abs(row - br) == abs(col - bc):
            return False
    return True
```

### 2. **Backtracking Pattern**

def backtrack(bishops, remaining):
    if remaining == 0:
        return 1
    
    count = 0
    for pos in range(n * n):
        row, col = pos // n, pos % n
        
        if can_place_bishop(row, col, bishops):
            bishops.append((row, col))
            count += backtrack(bishops, remaining - 1)
            bishops.pop()
    
    return count
```

### 3. **Diagonal Tracking**
```python
def track_diagonals(bishops):
    diagonals = set()
    for row, col in bishops:
        # Add all positions on the same diagonal
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(n):
                if abs(i - row) == abs(j - col):
                    diagonals.add((i, j))
    return diagonals
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Variations & Related Questions

### ðŸ”„ **Variations of the Original Problem**

#### **Variation 1: Weighted Bishop Attacks**
**Problem**: Each bishop has a weight. Find the total weight of attacking bishop pairs.
```python
def weighted_bishop_attacks(n, bishops, weights):
    # weights[i] = weight of bishop i
    diagonal1 = {}  # i + j
    diagonal2 = {}  # i - j
    
    total_weight = 0
    
    for i, (r, c) in enumerate(bishops):
        d1 = r + c
        d2 = r - c
        
        # Add weight from existing bishops on same diagonals
        if d1 in diagonal1:
            for other_idx in diagonal1[d1]:
                total_weight += weights[i] * weights[other_idx]
        if d2 in diagonal2:
            for other_idx in diagonal2[d2]:
                total_weight += weights[i] * weights[other_idx]
        
        # Add current bishop to diagonals
        if d1 not in diagonal1:
            diagonal1[d1] = []
        diagonal1[d1].append(i)
        
        if d2 not in diagonal2:
            diagonal2[d2] = []
        diagonal2[d2].append(i)
    
    return total_weight
```

#### **Variation 2: Constrained Bishop Attacks**
**Problem**: Count attacks only if bishops are within a certain distance.
```python

    diagonal1 = {}  # i + j
    diagonal2 = {}  # i - j
    
    count = 0
    
    for i, (r, c) in enumerate(bishops):
        d1 = r + c
        d2 = r - c
        
        # Check diagonal1 attacks within distance
        if d1 in diagonal1:
            for other_r, other_c in diagonal1[d1]:
                if abs(r - other_r) <= max_distance:
                    count += 1
        
        # Check diagonal2 attacks within distance
        if d2 in diagonal2:
            for other_r, other_c in diagonal2[d2]:
                if abs(r - other_r) <= max_distance:
                    count += 1
        
        # Add current bishop to diagonals
        if d1 not in diagonal1:
            diagonal1[d1] = []
        diagonal1[d1].append((r, c))
        
        if d2 not in diagonal2:
            diagonal2[d2] = []
        diagonal2[d2].append((r, c))
    
    return count
```

#### **Variation 3: Bishop Attack Groups**
**Problem**: Find the number of groups of bishops that can all attack each other.
```python
def bishop_attack_groups(n, bishops):
    diagonal1 = {}  # i + j
    diagonal2 = {}  # i - j
    
    # Group bishops by diagonals
    for r, c in bishops:
        d1 = r + c
        d2 = r - c
        
        if d1 not in diagonal1:
            diagonal1[d1] = []
        diagonal1[d1].append((r, c))
        
        if d2 not in diagonal2:
            diagonal2[d2] = []
        diagonal2[d2].append((r, c))
    
    # Count groups (each diagonal forms a group)
    groups = 0
    for diagonal in diagonal1.values():
        if len(diagonal) > 1:
            groups += 1
    
    for diagonal in diagonal2.values():
        if len(diagonal) > 1:
            groups += 1
    
    return groups
```

#### **Variation 4: Bishop Attack Paths**

```python
def bishop_attack_paths(n, bishops):
    diagonal1 = {}  # i + j
    diagonal2 = {}  # i - j
    
    paths = 0
    
    for r, c in bishops:
        d1 = r + c
        d2 = r - c
        
        # Count paths on diagonal1
        if d1 in diagonal1:
            paths += len(diagonal1[d1])
        
        # Count paths on diagonal2
        if d2 in diagonal2:
            paths += len(diagonal2[d2])
        
        # Add current bishop to diagonals
        if d1 not in diagonal1:
            diagonal1[d1] = []
        diagonal1[d1].append((r, c))
        
        if d2 not in diagonal2:

        diagonal2[d2].append((r, c))
    
    return paths
```

#### **Variation 5: Dynamic Bishop Attacks**

```python
class DynamicBishopCounter:
    def __init__(self, n):
        self.n = n
        self.diagonal1 = {}  # i + j
        self.diagonal2 = {}  # i - j

        d1 = r + c
        d2 = r - c
