# CSES Filled Subgrid Count II - Problem Analysis

## Problem Statement
Given a 2D grid of size n×m, count the number of filled subgrids of any size. A subgrid is filled if all cells in it contain the same value.

### Input
The first input line has two integers n and m: the dimensions of the grid.
Then there are n lines describing the grid. Each line has m integers: the values in the grid.

### Output
Print one integer: the number of filled subgrids of any size.

### Constraints
- 1 ≤ n,m ≤ 100
- 1 ≤ grid[i][j] ≤ 10^9

### Example
```
Input:
3 3
1 1 2
1 1 2
3 3 3

Output:
14
```

## Solution Progression

### Approach 1: Check All Possible Subgrids - O(n³ × m³)
**Description**: Check all possible subgrids of all sizes to count those that are filled.

```python
def filled_subgrid_count_all_sizes_naive(n, m, grid):
    count = 0
    
    # Try all possible subgrid sizes
    for k in range(1, min(n, m) + 1):
        for i in range(n - k + 1):
            for j in range(m - k + 1):
                # Check if this k×k subgrid is filled
                first_value = grid[i][j]
                is_filled = True
                
                for di in range(k):
                    for dj in range(k):
                        if grid[i + di][j + dj] != first_value:
                            is_filled = False
                            break
                    if not is_filled:
                        break
                
                if is_filled:
                    count += 1
    
    return count
```

**Why this is inefficient**: We need to check all possible subgrid sizes, leading to O(n³ × m³) time complexity.

### Improvement 1: Optimized Checking with Early Termination - O(n³ × m³)
**Description**: Optimize the checking process with early termination when a mismatch is found.

```python
def filled_subgrid_count_all_sizes_optimized(n, m, grid):
    count = 0
    
    # Try all possible subgrid sizes
    for k in range(1, min(n, m) + 1):
        for i in range(n - k + 1):
            for j in range(m - k + 1):
                # Check if this k×k subgrid is filled
                first_value = grid[i][j]
                is_filled = True
                
                # Check each cell in the subgrid
                for di in range(k):
                    for dj in range(k):
                        if grid[i + di][j + dj] != first_value:
                            is_filled = False
                            break
                    if not is_filled:
                        break
                
                if is_filled:
                    count += 1
    
    return count
```

**Why this improvement works**: Early termination reduces the number of cells checked when a mismatch is found early.

## Final Optimal Solution

```python
n, m = map(int, input().split())

# Read the grid
grid = []
for _ in range(n):
    row = list(map(int, input().split()))
    grid.append(row)

def count_all_filled_subgrids(n, m, grid):
    count = 0
    
    # Try all possible subgrid sizes
    for k in range(1, min(n, m) + 1):
        for i in range(n - k + 1):
            for j in range(m - k + 1):
                # Check if this k×k subgrid is filled
                first_value = grid[i][j]
                is_filled = True
                
                # Check each cell in the subgrid
                for di in range(k):
                    for dj in range(k):
                        if grid[i + di][j + dj] != first_value:
                            is_filled = False
                            break
                    if not is_filled:
                        break
                
                if is_filled:
                    count += 1
    
    return count

result = count_all_filled_subgrids(n, m, grid)
print(result)
```

        for dj in range(k):
            if grid[start_i + di][start_j + dj] != first_value:
                return False

            for j in range(m - k + 1):
                # Process subgrid of size k×k starting at (i, j)
                pass
```
